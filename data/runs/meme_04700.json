      "text": "One Battle After Another is a 2025 American black comedy action thriller film written, co-produced, and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. It is loosely based on and inspired by the 1990 novel Vineland by Thomas Pynchon. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti (in her film debut). It follows an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into his former combative lifestyle when he and his daughter are pursued by a corrupt military officer. Anderson had wanted to adapt Vineland since the early 2000s and, eventually, incorporated his own stories into the narrative while writing the screenplay. The film was shot in California between January and June 2024 using VistaVision, becoming one of the first films to use this format for principal photography since the 1960s."
