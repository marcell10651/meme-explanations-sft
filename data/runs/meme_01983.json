Many exterior scenes were filmed at the Fort Bowie set built in the Province of Almería, Spain, where the desert landscape and climate that characterizes part of the province have made it a much utilized setting for Western films, among those A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West, and later 800 Bullets. The Fort Bowie set was originally built for the film The Deserter. There are two different English language versions of the movie, shorter with James Coburn's own voice and longer with different voice actors and music. James Coburn was not involved in longer cut dubbing. It also features some of the same songs from Day of Anger starring Lee Van Cleef."
