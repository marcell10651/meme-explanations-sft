      "text": "Two-Face is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bob Kane, and first appeared in Detective Comics #66 (August 1942). He has become one of the superhero Batman's most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. In his comic book appearances, Two-Face is the alter ego of Harvey Dent, Gotham City's former district attorney who becomes a criminal mastermind obsessed with duality and the number two. Half of his face is hideously scarred after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him. The resulting disfigurement drives him insane and causes him to make decisions based on the flip of a coin. The Modern Age of Comic Books portrays the character as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alternate personality that developed as a result of childhood abuse."

      "text": "A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment, and often employed for rituals and rites. Masks have been used since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes, as well as in the performing arts and for entertainment. They are usually worn on the face, although they may also be positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer's body. In art history, especially sculpture, \"mask\" is the term for a face without a body that is not modelled in the round (which would make it a \"head\"), but for example appears in low relief. Etymology The word \"mask\" appeared in English in the 1530s, from Middle French masque \"covering to hide or guard the face\", derived in turn from Italian maschera, from Medieval Latin masca \"mask, specter, nightmare\". This word is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Arabic maskharah مَسْخَرَۃٌ \"buffoon\", from the verb sakhira \"to ridicule\"."

Many animals may express emotions through their face. Sense organs in the faces of different animals are varied such as the snout, and the proboscis. Many animals are flat-faced (brachycephalic) such as the pug dog. The human face is crucial for identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities may adversely affect the psyche. Human face Structure The front of the human head is called the face. It includes several distinct areas, of which the main features are: The forehead, comprising the skin beneath the hairline, bordered laterally by the temples and inferiorly by eyebrows and ears The eyes, sitting in the orbit and protected by eyelids and eyelashes The distinctive human nose shape, nostrils, and nasal septum The cheeks, covering the maxilla and mandible (or jaw), the extremity of which is the chin The mouth, with the upper"

      "text": "A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissue concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head. Human head The human head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull, hyoid bone and cervical vertebrae. The skull consists of the brain case which encloses the cranial cavity, and the facial skeleton, which includes the mandible. There are eight bones in the brain case and fourteen in the facial skeleton."
