      "text": "Bedtime (also called putting to bed or tucking in) is a ritual part of parenting to help children feel more secure and become accustomed to a more rigid schedule of sleep than they might prefer. The ritual of bedtime is aimed at facilitating the transition from wakefulness to sleep. It may involve bedtime stories, children's songs, nursery rhymes, bed-making and getting children to change into nightwear. In some religious households, prayers are said shortly before going to bed. Sleep training may be part of the bedtime ritual for babies and toddlers. In adult use, the term means simply \"time for bed\", similar to curfew, as in \"It's past my bedtime\". Some people are accustomed to drinking a nightcap or herbal tea at bedtime. Sleeping coaches are also used to help individuals reach their bedtime goals. Researchers studying sleep are finding patterns revealing that cell phone use at night disturbs going to sleep at one's bedtime and achieving a good night's sleep."

In all versions of the story, they are depicted as little people who form the workforce of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, and are paid in cocoa beans. However, their appearance and backstory change depending on the version. Design and characteristics The Oompa-Loompas are described as being no larger than medium-sized dolls, with rosy-white skin and long golden-brown hair. They wear the same clothes they wore at Loompaland: the men wear deerskins, the women wear leaves and the children wear nothing at all. Before moving to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the Oompa-Loompas lived in Loompaland, where they lived in constant fear of the predators that would eat them. Their main source of food were green caterpillars that tasted disgusting, so they would mash the caterpillars with bugs and plants to make them slightly less disgusting."
