Born into a musical family in McComb, Mississippi, Brandy was raised in Carson, California, where she began her career as a backing vocalist for youth music groups. After signing to Atlantic Records, she rose to prominence in the mid-1990s with her debut studio album, Brandy (1994), which spawned the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles \"I Wanna Be Down\", \"Baby\", and \"Brokenhearted\". She became a television star with her lead role on the UPN sitcom Moesha (1996–2001) and portrayed the titular character in the television film Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997)."
