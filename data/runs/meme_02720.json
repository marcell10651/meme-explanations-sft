A period during which goods are sold for a reduced price may also be referred to as a \"sale\". The seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in an interaction with a buyer, which may occur at the point of sale or in response to a purchase order from a customer. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The seller, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment."

The most common use of the title is in the retail industry, but this job title is also used in the context of accountancy for the person responsible for receiving and disbursing money or within branch banking in the United Kingdom for the job known in the United States as a bank teller. Retail In a shop, a cashier (or checkout operator) is an employee who scans the goods that the customer wishes to purchase through a cash register. In most modern stores, the items are scanned by a barcode positioned on the item with the use of a laser scanner. After all of the items have been scanned, the cashier then collects the payment (in cash, check, and/or by credit/debit card) for the goods or services exchanged, records the amount received, makes change, and issues receipts or tickets to customers."

      "text": "Morning is either the period from sunrise to noon, or the period from midnight to noon. In the first definition it is preceded by the twilight period of dawn, and there are no exact times for when morning begins (also true of evening and night) because it can vary according to one's latitude, and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, when afternoon starts. Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Originally, the term referred to sunrise. Etymology The Modern English words \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\" began in Middle English as morwening, developing into morwen, then morwe, and eventually morrow. English, unlike some other languages, has separate terms for \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\", despite their common root. Other languages, like Dutch, Scots and German, may use a single word – morgen – to signify both \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\"."
