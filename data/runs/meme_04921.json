      "text": "Perfection is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. The term designates a range of diverse, if often kindred, concepts used in a variety of fields. Term and concept The noun \"perfection\", the adjective \"perfect\", and the verb \"to perfect\" derive from the Latin verb \"perficere\" – \"to finish\" or \"to bring to an end\". The ancient Greek word for \"perfection\" was \"teleiotes\". The Greek polymath Aristotle (384–322 BCE) distinguished three concepts of perfection: 1. that which was complete – which contained all the requisite parts; 2. that which was so good that nothing of the kind could be better; 3. that which had attained its purpose. The Polish philosopher Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886 – 1980) notes that perfection is often confused with other qualities, such as \"excellence\". The German polymath Leibniz (1646–1716), who thought the world to be the best of all possible worlds, never called it perfect."
