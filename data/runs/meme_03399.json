      "text": "\"Young Boy\" is a song by English musician Paul McCartney, included as the fifth track on his 10th solo studio album, Flaming Pie (1997). McCartney reportedly started working on the song in August 1994. The initial tracks were recorded in February 1995 at Steve Miller's studio in Sun Valley, Idaho, and were completed in May at McCartney's home studio. On 28 April 1997, the song was released as the first single from Flaming Pie, peaking at No. 3 in Spain and No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart. The single featured two non-album B-sides: \"Looking for You\" and \"Broomstick\". In the United States, Capitol Records chose to issue \"The World Tonight\" as the album's lead single instead."
