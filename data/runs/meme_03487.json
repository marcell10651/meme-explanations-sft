He is the eccentric founder and proprietor of the Wonka Chocolate Factory. Wonka has been depicted in film several times. In 1971, Willy Wonka was portrayed by Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Wilder's portrayal in the film is widely beloved and is considered one of his greatest roles. Johnny Depp played the character in 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which polarized critics and audiences. In 2023, Timothée Chalamet portrayed the character in a standalone film that tells his origin story titled Wonka. Chalamet's performance was both praised and criticized. Wilder, Depp, and Chalamet all received Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical for their performances."
