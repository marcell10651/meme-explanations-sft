      "text": "By The People is a 2005 Indian Malayalam-language vigilante thriller film directed by Jayaraj and produced by Milan Jaleel under his banner Galaxy Films. It is the sequel of 4 the People (2004) and the prequel of Of the People (2008). Narain reprises his role from the original. The film marks the debut of Surabhi Lakshmi. Plot Two years after the events in 4 the People, Rajan Mathew (Narain) is working an administrative job after being transferred for killing Vivek among the four-member group, and the remaining three members- Arvind Sebastian (Arun), Eshwar (Arjun Bose) and Shafeek (Padma Kumar) are imprisoned. College students in a band named Pulse, including a porter Sudhakaran (Vinayakan), auto driver Sathyan (Sreejith Ravi) and a one leg cripple (J Kutty), inspired by the four, form a more aggressive team to fight corruption by resorting to killing corrupt individuals, their group being named \"By the people\"."

      "text": "A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \"hand\" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \"hands\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \"hands\" though opposable thumbs are lacking. Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally—for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand. The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; however, these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers."

      "text": "A society () is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members. Human social structures are complex and highly cooperative, featuring the specialization of labor via social roles. Societies construct roles and other patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts acceptable or unacceptable—these expectations around behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. So far as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis."
