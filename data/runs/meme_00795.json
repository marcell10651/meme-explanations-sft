      "text": "Reddit ( RED-it, stylized in lowercase) is an American proprietary social news aggregation and forum social media platform. Registered users (commonly referred to as \"redditors\") submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down (\"upvoted\" or \"downvoted\") by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called \"subreddits\". Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page. Reddit administrators moderate the communities. Moderation is also conducted by subreddit-specific moderators, who are unpaid volunteers. It is operated by Reddit, Inc., based in San Francisco. As of December 2025, Reddit is the sixth or seventh most-visited website in the world."

      "text": "Perfection is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. The term designates a range of diverse, if often kindred, concepts used in a variety of fields. Term and concept The noun \"perfection\", the adjective \"perfect\", and the verb \"to perfect\" derive from the Latin verb \"perficere\" – \"to finish\" or \"to bring to an end\". The ancient Greek word for \"perfection\" was \"teleiotes\". The Greek polymath Aristotle (384–322 BCE) distinguished three concepts of perfection: 1. that which was complete – which contained all the requisite parts; 2. that which was so good that nothing of the kind could be better; 3. that which had attained its purpose. The Polish philosopher Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886 – 1980) notes that perfection is often confused with other qualities, such as \"excellence\". The German polymath Leibniz (1646–1716), who thought the world to be the best of all possible worlds, never called it perfect."

      "text": "Success is the state or condition of meeting a defined range of expectations. It may be viewed as the opposite of failure. The criteria for success depend on context, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. One person might consider a success what another person considers a failure, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a success, another might consider to be a failure, a qualified success or a neutral situation. For example, a film that is a commercial failure or even a box-office bomb can go on to receive a cult following, with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness."

      "text": "Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's own life, or the world at large. As a verb, Merriam-Webster defines hope as \"to expect with confidence\" or \"to cherish a desire with anticipation\". Among its opposites are dejection, hopelessness, and despair. Hope finds expression through many dimensions of human life, including practical reasoning, the religious virtue of hope, legal doctrine, and literature, alongside cultural and mythological aspects. In psychology American professor of psychology Barbara Fredrickson argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms, opening us to new creative possibilities. Frederickson argues that with great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas, as well as such positive emotions as happiness and joy, courage, and empowerment, drawn from four different areas of one's self: from a cognitive, psychological, social, or physical perspective."

      "text": "Praise as a form of social interaction expresses recognition, reassurance or admiration. Praise is expressed verbally as well as by body language (facial expression and gestures). Verbal praise consists of a positive evaluations of another's attributes or actions, where the evaluator presumes the validity of the standards on which the evaluation is based. As a form of social manipulation, praise becomes a form of reward and furthers behavioral reinforcement by conditioning. The influence of praise on an individual can depend on many factors, including the context, the meanings the praise may convey, and the characteristics and interpretations of the recipient. While praise may share some predictive relationships (both positive and negative) with tangible (material) rewards, praise tends to be less salient and expected, conveys more information about competence, and is typically given more immediately after the desired behavior."

      "text": "A post-credits scene (also known as a stinger, end tag, or credit cookie) is a short teaser clip that appears after the closing credits have rolled and sometimes after a production logo of a film, TV show, or video game has run. It is usually either written for humor or to set up a sequel. Sometimes, one or more mid-credits scenes are also inserted partly through the closing credits, typically for the purpose of maintaining the audience's attention so they do not need to wait for the entire credits roll to finish for a teaser. History Post-credits scenes may have their origins in encores, an additional performance added to the end of staged shows in response to audience applause. Opera encores were common practice in the 19th century, when the story was often interrupted so a singer could repeat an aria, but fell out of favor in the 1920s due to rising emphasis on dramatic storytelling rather than vocal performance."
