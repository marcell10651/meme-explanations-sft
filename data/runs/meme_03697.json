It was released theatrically on April 27, 2022. Plot Lawyer Kang Ho-chang receives a call to from his son's teacher Song Jeong-wook to come to Haneum International School, where he meets four other parents: math teacher Jung, retired police officer Park Mu-Taek and his wife, and doctor Do Ji-yeol. The school's principal informs them that one of the students, Kim Gon-woo, was rescued from drowning in a lake. Jeong-wook reveals that the boy, now in a comatose state, had previously sent her a letter claiming that he was being bullied by sons of the four parents, including Kang Han-gyeol, Ho-chang's son."

      "text": "Looking is the act of intentionally focusing visual perception on someone or something, for the purpose of obtaining information, and possibly to convey interest or another sentiment. A large number of troponyms exist to describe variations of looking at things, with prominent examples including the verbs \"stare, gaze, gape, gawp, gawk, goggle, glare, glimpse, glance, peek, peep, peer, squint, leer, gloat, and ogle\". Additional terms with nuanced meanings include viewing, watching, eyeing, observing, beholding, and scanning. Looking is both a physical act of directing the focus of the eyes, and a psychological act of interpreting what is seen and choosing whether to continue looking at it, or to look elsewhere. Where more than one person is involved, looking may lead to eye contact between those doing the looking, which raises further implications for the relationship established through that act."

      "text": "Staring is a prolonged gaze or fixed look. In staring, one subject or person is the continual focus of visual interest, for a long amount of time. The meaning, purpose, and rudeness, of staring varies widely between cultures. Staring can be interpreted as being either hostile like disapproval of another's behavior, or the result of intense concentration, interest or affection. Staring behavior can be considered as a form of aggression like when it is an invasion of an individual's privacy in certain contexts, or as a nonverbal cue to convey feelings of attraction in a social setting. The resultant behavior or action defines whether it is aggressive in nature (e.g. leering that results in street harassment), passive or active expression of attraction, etc. However, to some extent staring often occurs accidentally, and often a person would be simply staring into a space for awareness, or could be lost in thought (sometimes known as daydreaming), stupefied, or be unable to see."

      "text": "Shit is an English-language profanity. As a noun, it refers to fecal matter, and as a verb it means to defecate; in the plural (\"the shits\"), it means diarrhea. Shite is a common variant in British and Irish English. As a slang term, shit has many meanings, including: nonsense, foolishness, something of little value or quality, trivial and usually boastful or inaccurate talk or a contemptible person. It could also be used to refer to any other noun in general or as an expression of annoyance, concern, surprise or anger. Etymology The word is likely derived from Old English, having the nouns scite (dung, attested only in place names) and scitte (diarrhoea) and the verb scītan (to defecate, attested only in bescītan, to cover with excrement); eventually it morphed into Middle English schītte (excrement), schyt (diarrhoea) and shiten (to defecate), and it is virtually certain that it was used in some form by preliterate Germanic tribes at the time of the Roman Empire."
