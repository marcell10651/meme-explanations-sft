It is one of the best-known tales associated with One Thousand and One Nights (often known in English as The Arabian Nights), despite not being part of the original text; it was added by the Frenchman Antoine Galland, based on a folk tale that he heard from the Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab. Sources Known along with Ali Baba as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original Nights collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book Les mille et une nuits by its French translator, Antoine Galland. John Payne quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary recording Galland's encounter with a Maronite storyteller from Aleppo, Hanna Diyab."

      "text": "\"Walkin\" is a song by American rapper Denzel Curry, released on January 24, 2022 as the lead single from his fifth studio album Melt My Eyez See Your Future (2022). It was produced by Kal Banx. Composition The production in the song changes from the style of boom bap to that of southern rap, juxtaposed with vocals. Lyrically, Denzel Curry raps about the struggles and changing of everyday life as the state of the world is regressing, such as racial and wealth inequality, and striving for success through difficult times, switching his flows as well. Music video A music video for the song was directed by Adrian Villagomez and released alongside the single. Taking on a sci-fi western theme, it finds Denzel Curry trekking across a desert planet alone, first walking through a village and moving past barren sand dunes, children playing on a swing set, and villains trying to kill him. He collapses on his knees several times throughout the journey."
