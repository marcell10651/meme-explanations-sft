      "text": "\"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy\" is a 1973 song written and recorded by James Brown, for the film Slaughter's Big Rip-Off. The song appeared on the film's soundtrack, and was released as a single in 1973. The song, and wider album, emerged from an era which saw the rise of blaxploitation films. Such films represented the struggle of African Americans against poverty and crime under a white-dominated society. While \"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy\" was received well by contemporary and modern audiences alike, it received negative reviews from critics. Brown used the same backing track and chord progression from his 1966 hit \"Money Won't Change You\" when composing the song, which prompted a poor critical response. Despite Brown's reuse of his earlier work, \"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy\" showcased the typical funk hallmarks of his more popular work. The song performed strongly on three separate Billboard charts as well as the Cashbox chart."

Reception In a review for Amazon, music journalist Roni Sarig said \"BG back up their obnoxious idiocy with some fairly wise musical maneuvering.
