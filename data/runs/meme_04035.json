      "text": "Please is a word used in the English language to indicate politeness and respect while making a request. Derived from shortening the phrase \"if you please\" or \"if it please(s) you\", the term has taken on substantial nuance based on its intonation and the relationship between the persons between whom it is used. In much of the Western world, use of the word is considered proper etiquette, and parents and authority figures often imprint upon children the importance of saying \"please\" when asking for something from an early age, leading to the description of the term as \"the magic word\". Origin and understanding \"Please\" is a shortening of the phrase, if you please, an intransitive, ergative form taken from if it please you, which is in turn a calque of the French s'il vous plaît, which replaced pray."
