      "text": "Rubeus Hagrid () is a fictional character in the Harry Potter series of novels by J. K. Rowling. He was introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997) as a half-giant who is the gamekeeper and groundskeeper at the wizarding school Hogwarts. He is a member of the Order of the Phoenix and eventually becomes the Care of Magical Creatures professor. Hagrid is portrayed by Robbie Coltrane in all eight Harry Potter films. Creation and development Rubeus Hagrid was one of the first characters Rowling created. In a 1999 interview, she explained that the name \"Hagrid\" is an Old English word, referring to hagridden, meaning 'tormented by hags'. She said it means \"you'd had a bad night\" and she explained that Hagrid \"has a lot of bad nights\" due to his heavy drinking. In Latin, \"Rubeus\" means \"red\", and was chosen because Rowling conceived of Hagrid as an \"earthy, warm, and physical man\"."

      "text": "Draco Lucius Malfoy is a fictional character and a major antagonist in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. He is a student in Harry Potter's year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is frequently accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who act as henchmen. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get what he wants; he is also a cunning user of magic. He was played by Tom Felton in the Harry Potter film series, while Lox Pratt is set to portray him in the TV series adaptation. Character development Draco serves as a foil to the hero, Harry Potter, and is loosely based on bullies Rowling encountered during her school days. Harry first encounters Draco's snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin's. Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments."
