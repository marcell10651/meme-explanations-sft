      "text": "The Caletes or Caleti (Gaulish: Caletoi \"the hard [stubborn, tough] ones\"; Latin: Calētēs or Calētī) were a Belgic or Gallic tribe dwelling in Pays de Caux, in present-day Normandy, during the Iron Age and the Roman period. Name They are mentioned as Caletes (var. Caletos, Cadetes) by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), as Káletoi (Κάλετοι) and Kalétous (Καλέτους) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), as Galetos (var. Galletos) by Pliny (1st c. AD), as Kalē̃tai (Καλη̃ται) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), and as Caleti by Orosius (early 5th c. AD). The Gaulish ethnonym Caletoi literally means 'the hard ones', that is to say 'the stubborn' or 'the tough'. It derives from the Proto-Celtic stem *kaleto- ('hard, cruel, strong'; cf. Old Irish calath 'heroic', Middle Welsh caled 'hard'), itself from Proto-Indo-European *ḱelto-, meaning 'cold' (cf. Avest. sarǝta- 'cold', OEng. haeled 'hero', Lat. callēre 'to be hardened [by the experience], insensible')."

      "text": "Comes (plural comites), translated as count, was a Roman title, generally linked to a comitatus or comital office. The word comes originally meant \"companion\" or \"follower\", deriving from \"com-\" (\"with\") and \"ire\" (\"go\"). The special lasting meaning derives from the position of a follower within a comitatus, which was a retinue, or group of followers, such as those of magnates. In some instances these were sufficiently large and/or formal to justify specific denomination, such as a \"cohors amicorum\". The word comes is the origin of the much later terms for counts within the medieval nobility, and counties as their territorial jurisdictions. Ancient Roman religion Comes was a common epithet or title that was added to the name of a hero or god in order to denote relation with another god. The coinage of Roman Emperor Constantine I declared him \"comes\" to Sol Invictus (\"Unconquered Sun\") qua god."
