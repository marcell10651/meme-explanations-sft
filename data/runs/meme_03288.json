      "text": "Fists in the Pocket (Italian: I pugni in tasca) is a 1965 Italian satirical drama film written and directed by Marco Bellocchio and starring Lou Castel. It was Bellocchio's first feature film and became one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. The film centers on a young man suffering from epilepsy, who plots the murders of the members of his dysfunctional family. In 2008, Fists in the Pocket was included in the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage's 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that \"have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.\" Plot Four siblings, a sister and three brothers, live with their blind, widowed mother in a provincial villa. The younger brothers Alessandro and Leone are epileptics, while sister Giulia, with whom Alessandro shares an incestuous attraction, is mentally disturbed. Augusto, the eldest brother and apparently sane, is the family's only provider."

This statement was contained in a joint editorial, entitled \"Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link\", printed on 7 February 1977 in People's Daily, the journal Red Flag and the PLA Daily. History The policy was advocated by the Chinese Communist Party chairman Hua Guofeng, Mao's successor, who had earlier ended the Cultural Revolution and arrested the Gang of Four. On a 7 February 1977 editorial titled \"Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link\" which appeared in People's Daily, Red Flag, and People's Liberation Army Daily, Hua articulated the \"Two Whatevers\" slogan: \"We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave\"."
