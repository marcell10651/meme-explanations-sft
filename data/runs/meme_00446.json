      "text": "Yeah Yeah Yeahs are an American indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000. The group consists of vocalist/pianist Karen O, guitarist/keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase; they do not have a bassist but have been complemented during live shows by David Pajo and Imaad Wasif. They are known for energetic performances and a blend of genres, including art rock and dance-rock. Yeah Yeah Yeahs found critical and commercial success with their debut album, Fever to Tell (2003), which is cited as their best work. It produced the breakthrough single \"Maps\", which became the band's signature song. They issued a second album, Show Your Bones (2006), and shifted to dance-punk with their third, It's Blitz! (2009). Both records received positive reviews, and the latter spawned the hit single \"Heads Will Roll\". The band's fourth album, Mosquito (2013), became their highest-charting record in the United States but did not match the reception of its predecessors."

      "text": "Disbelief (sometimes decapitalized to \"disbelief\") is a German heavy metal band from Hesse. Their music is rooted in death metal, but has melancholic tendencies. History The band was formed in 1990, but did not become one solid line-up for several years. They began with Karsten Jäger, Oliver Lenz, and drummer Markus Gnap, with guitarist/bassist Denis Musiol joining later. They released their first demo the following year. After two more demo tapes, five years, and the replacement of Gnap and Musiol with Tommy Fritsch, Jochen Trunk, and Kai Bergerin, they released their self-titled album in 1997. Their second album, Infected, was released in 1998. A year later, they replaced Fritsch with Jan-Dirk Löffler and received a new recording contract from Massacre Records. After a few more albums, they became signed to Nuclear Blast, which distributed their 2004 record, Spreading the Rage, to North America and helped them to gain a wider fanbase."
