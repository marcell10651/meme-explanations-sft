      "text": "A toddler is a child approximately 1 to 3 years old, though definitions vary. The toddler years are a time of great cognitive, emotional and social development. The word is derived from \"toddle\", which means to walk unsteadily, as children at this age do. Developmental milestones Toddler development can be broken down into a number of interrelated areas. There is reasonable consensus about what these areas may include: Physical: growth or an increase in size. Gross motor: the control of large muscles which enable walking, running, jumping and climbing. Fine motor: the ability to control small muscles; enabling the toddler to feed themselves, draw and manipulate objects. Vision: the ability to see near and far and interpret what is seen. Hearing and speech: the ability to hear and receive information and listen (interpret), and the ability to understand and learn language and use it to communicate effectively."
