      "text": "Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. Additionally, the term can refer to a physical television set rather than the medium of transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports. The medium is capable of more than \"radio broadcasting\", which refers to an audio signal sent to radio receivers. Television became available in crude experimental forms in the 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries."

      "text": "Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcast, and display of moving-image media. Video was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode-ray tube (CRT) systems, which, in turn, were replaced by flat-panel displays. Video systems vary in display resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, color reproduction, and other qualities. Both analog and digital video can be carried on a variety of media, including radio, magnetic tape, optical discs, computer files, and network streaming. Etymology The word video comes from the Latin video, \"I see,\" the first-person singular present indicative of videre, \"to see\". History Analog video Video developed from facsimile systems developed in the mid-19th century. Mechanical video scanners, such as the Nipkow disk, were patented as early as 1884, but it took several decades before practical video systems could be developed."
