      "text": "\"Different Colors\" is a song written and recorded by American rock band Walk the Moon for their second studio album, Talking Is Hard (2014). The song was released to US alternative radio stations by RCA Records as the album's second single on May 5, 2015. Described as an alternative rock, electropop, indie rock, and pop song, it is lyrically about celebrating and embracing each other's differences by speaking out against discrimination of any kind. Some music critics gave \"Different Colors\" praise for its chorus and production; others felt it was a step down from the band's earlier singles. The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, becoming Walk the Moon's third top ten track on the chart. A music video for the song was released on June 11, 2015, featuring footage of the band touring with colorful visuals. The song was performed live by Walk the Moon at award shows, including the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards."

      "text": "\"Walkin\" is a song by American rapper Denzel Curry, released on January 24, 2022 as the lead single from his fifth studio album Melt My Eyez See Your Future (2022). It was produced by Kal Banx. Composition The production in the song changes from the style of boom bap to that of southern rap, juxtaposed with vocals. Lyrically, Denzel Curry raps about the struggles and changing of everyday life as the state of the world is regressing, such as racial and wealth inequality, and striving for success through difficult times, switching his flows as well. Music video A music video for the song was directed by Adrian Villagomez and released alongside the single. Taking on a sci-fi western theme, it finds Denzel Curry trekking across a desert planet alone, first walking through a village and moving past barren sand dunes, children playing on a swing set, and villains trying to kill him. He collapses on his knees several times throughout the journey."
