      "text": "\"Walkin\" is a song by American rapper Denzel Curry, released on January 24, 2022 as the lead single from his fifth studio album Melt My Eyez See Your Future (2022). It was produced by Kal Banx. Composition The production in the song changes from the style of boom bap to that of southern rap, juxtaposed with vocals. Lyrically, Denzel Curry raps about the struggles and changing of everyday life as the state of the world is regressing, such as racial and wealth inequality, and striving for success through difficult times, switching his flows as well. Music video A music video for the song was directed by Adrian Villagomez and released alongside the single. Taking on a sci-fi western theme, it finds Denzel Curry trekking across a desert planet alone, first walking through a village and moving past barren sand dunes, children playing on a swing set, and villains trying to kill him. He collapses on his knees several times throughout the journey."

      "text": "For Your Eyes Only is a 1981 spy film, the twelfth film in the James Bond franchise produced by Eon Productions, and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film also co-stars Carole Bouquet, Chaim Topol, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Julian Glover, and marked the feature directorial debut of John Glen, who had served as a film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. The film was written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. Although the script is principally based on two Ian Fleming short stories, \"For Your Eyes Only\" and \"Risico\", some elements of the plot were also inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The film follows Bond as he attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek smugglers along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents."
