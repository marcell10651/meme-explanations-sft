He is also the founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort. In the novels, Dumbledore is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential wizards of his time. Renowned for his wisdom, kindness, and formidable magical abilities, he plays a crucial role in shaping the events of the wizarding world. As a mentor to Harry Potter, he provides guidance and crucial knowledge in the fight against Voldemort. Despite his benevolent image, Dumbledore's past is marked by tragedy and complexity, including his youthful association with Gellert Grindelwald, a dark wizard he later defeated. His philosophical views on power, love, and death are central themes in the series."

He is portrayed by Bryan Cranston. Walter is a skilled chemist who co-founded a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his partners. While his partners became wealthy, Walter became a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, barely making ends meet with his family: his wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), and their son, Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of the series, the day after his 50th birthday, he is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this discovery, Walter decides to manufacture and sell methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to ensure his family's financial security after his death. Due to his expertise, Walter's \"blue meth\" is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade."
