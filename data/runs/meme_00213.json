In the United Kingdom and most commonwealth countries, a \"student\" attends a secondary school or higher (e.g., college or university); those in primary or elementary schools are \"pupils\". Africa Nigeria In Nigeria, education is classified into four systems known as a 6-3-3-4 system of education. It implies six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary, three years in senior secondary and four years in the university. However, the number of years to be spent in university is mostly determined by the course of study. Some courses have longer study lengths than others. Those in primary school are often referred to as pupils. Those in university, as well as those in secondary school, are referred to as students. The Nigerian system of education also has other recognized categories like the polytechnics and colleges of education."

After this discovery, Walter decides to manufacture and sell methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to ensure his family's financial security after his death. Due to his expertise, Walter's \"blue meth\" is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade."
