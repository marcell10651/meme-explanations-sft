      "text": "A disaster is an event that causes such serious harm to people, buildings, economies, or the environment that the affected community cannot handle it alone. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction defines a disaster as \"a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society at any scale due to hazardous events interacting with conditions of exposure, vulnerability and capacity, leading to one or more of the following: human, material, economic and environmental losses and impacts\". Natural disasters like avalanches, floods, earthquakes, and wildfires are caused by natural hazards. Human-made disasters like oil spills, terrorist attacks and power outages are caused by people. It may be difficult to separate natural and human-made disasters because human actions can make natural disasters worse. Climate change also affects how often disasters due to extreme weather hazards happen."

      "text": "Shit happens is a slang sentence that is used as a simple existential observation that life is full of unfortunate unpredictable events, similar to \"c'est la vie\". The sentence is an acknowledgment that bad things happen to people seemingly for no particular reason. It can also be said less vulgarly, including phrases such as \"it happens\" or \"stuff happens\". History The fact that people have been remarking that \"shit happens\" has been attested from 1964, when Carl Werthman quoted an example in his UC Berkeley masters thesis; the relevant excerpt was published in The American City (edited by Anselm L. Strauss) in 1968. Examples of usage In 2011, Australian politician Tony Abbott, who was at the time Opposition Leader and leader of the Liberal Party (later becoming Prime Minister), used the sentence in an interview.

      "text": "Diligence—carefulness and persistent effort or work—is listed as one of the seven capital virtues. It can be indicative of a work ethic, the belief that work is good in itself. \"There is a perennial nobleness, and even sacredness, in work. Were he never so benighted, forgetful of his high calling, there is always hope in a man that actually and earnestly works: in idleness alone there is perpetual despair.\" —Thomas Carlyle In students Bernard et al. define diligence in students as the effort they put toward balanced and holistic development in mental, physical, social, and spiritual dimensions. They find that it correlates with academic performance, especially with younger students, and that the support of parents and educators encourages students to be diligent. Other factors that encourage student diligence include motivation, discipline, concentration, responsibility, and devotedness."

For instance, the English expression \"the very happy squirrel\" is a noun phrase which contains the adjective phrase \"very happy\". Phrases can consist of a single word or a complete sentence. In theoretical linguistics, phrases are often analyzed as units of syntactic structure such as a constituent. There is a difference between the common use of the term phrase and its technical use in linguistics. In common usage, a phrase is usually a group of words with some special idiomatic meaning or other significance, such as \"all rights reserved\", \"economical with the truth\", or \"kick the bucket\". It may be a euphemism, a saying or proverb, a fixed expression, a figure of speech, etc. In linguistics, these are known as phrasemes."
