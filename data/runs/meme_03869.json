      "text": "\"Different Colors\" is a song written and recorded by American rock band Walk the Moon for their second studio album, Talking Is Hard (2014). The song was released to US alternative radio stations by RCA Records as the album's second single on May 5, 2015. Described as an alternative rock, electropop, indie rock, and pop song, it is lyrically about celebrating and embracing each other's differences by speaking out against discrimination of any kind. Some music critics gave \"Different Colors\" praise for its chorus and production; others felt it was a step down from the band's earlier singles. The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, becoming Walk the Moon's third top ten track on the chart. A music video for the song was released on June 11, 2015, featuring footage of the band touring with colorful visuals. The song was performed live by Walk the Moon at award shows, including the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards."
