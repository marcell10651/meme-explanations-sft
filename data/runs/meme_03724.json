      "text": "Velocity is a measurement of speed in a certain direction of motion. It is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of physical objects. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning that both magnitude and direction are needed to define it (velocity vector). The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, a quantity that is measured in metres per second (m/s or m⋅s−1) in the SI (metric) system. For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar, whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object is said to be undergoing an acceleration. Definition Average velocity The average velocity of an object over a period of time is its change in position, Δ s {\\displaystyle \\Delta s} , divided by the duration of the period, Δ t {\\displaystyle \\Delta t} , given mathematically as v ¯ = Δ..."
