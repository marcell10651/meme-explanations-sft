      "text": "A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissue concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head. Human head The human head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull, hyoid bone and cervical vertebrae. The skull consists of the brain case which encloses the cranial cavity, and the facial skeleton, which includes the mandible. There are eight bones in the brain case and fourteen in the facial skeleton."

      "text": "The face is the front of the head in humans and many other animals that features most of the sense organs including the eyes, nose and mouth. Many animals may express emotions through their face. Sense organs in the faces of different animals are varied such as the snout, and the proboscis. Many animals are flat-faced (brachycephalic) such as the pug dog. The human face is crucial for identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities may adversely affect the psyche. Human face Structure The front of the human head is called the face. It includes several distinct areas, of which the main features are: The forehead, comprising the skin beneath the hairline, bordered laterally by the temples and inferiorly by eyebrows and ears The eyes, sitting in the orbit and protected by eyelids and eyelashes The distinctive human nose shape, nostrils, and nasal septum The cheeks, covering the maxilla and mandible (or jaw), the extremity of which is the chin The mouth, with the upper"

Humans are believed to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. Head hair was an exception, which was a survival trait because it provides thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, protects against ultraviolet radiation exposure (UV), and..."

      "text": "A debate between then-incumbent Democratic US President Joe Biden and then-former Republican President Donald Trump was held on June 27, 2024. Hosted by CNN, it was the first debate of that year's presidential election. Biden's performance in the debate, which was widely considered by media and political experts to be the poorest of any major party nominee in modern American history, raised substantial concerns about whether he would be capable of serving a second term as president. During the days and weeks following the debate, Biden declined in the polls and faced pressure from within his own party to end his presidential campaign. On July 21, Biden ultimately withdrew from the race and immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him in his place as the party's presidential nominee. Harris went on to lose the general election to Trump. Prelude Agreement to debate As the 2024 campaign developed, there was a serious possibility of no televised debates."

      "text": "Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear. Headphones are also known as earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural (around the ear) and supra-aural (over the ear) headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the drivers in place. Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces, consists of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal; within that category have been developed cordless air buds using wireless technology. A third type are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open."
