All the songs, with the notable exception of the title song, are sung as ballads and were arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle.

The album spent nine weeks at number one on the Billboard stereo album chart, and one week at number one on the corresponding mono album chart. At the 1961 Grammy Awards, Nice 'n' Easy was nominated for the Grammy Award as Album of the Year, Best Male Vocal Performance, Best Arrangement. The song \"Nice 'n' Easy\" was released as a single in 1960 and made it to number 60 on the charts.

      "text": "Nice ( NEESS; French pronunciation: [nis] ) is a French city located in the prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department. The Nice agglomeration extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly one million over an area of 744 km2 (287 sq mi). Located on the French Riviera, the southeastern coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the French Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. It is approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) from the principality of Monaco and 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the French–Italian border. Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region. The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by Menica Rondelly."
