      "text": "Politics is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of status or resources. The branch of social science that studies politics and government is referred to as political science. Politics may be used positively in the context of a \"political solution\" which is compromising and non-violent, or descriptively as \"the art or science of government\", but the word often also carries a negative connotation. The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or in a limited way, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it."

      "text": "A debate between then-incumbent Democratic US President Joe Biden and then-former Republican President Donald Trump was held on June 27, 2024. Hosted by CNN, it was the first debate of that year's presidential election. Biden's performance in the debate, which was widely considered by media and political experts to be the poorest of any major party nominee in modern American history, raised substantial concerns about whether he would be capable of serving a second term as president. During the days and weeks following the debate, Biden declined in the polls and faced pressure from within his own party to end his presidential campaign. On July 21, Biden ultimately withdrew from the race and immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him in his place as the party's presidential nominee. Harris went on to lose the general election to Trump. Prelude Agreement to debate As the 2024 campaign developed, there was a serious possibility of no televised debates."

      "text": "Modern Times is a 1936 American part-talkie satirical slapstick comedy film produced, written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. In Chaplin's last performance as the iconic Little Tramp, his character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film also stars Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Tiny Sandford and Chester Conklin. Modern Times has won many awards and honors, and is widely considered one of the greatest films ever. It was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Plot The Tramp works on an assembly line, where he suffers greatly due to the stress and pace of the repetitive work. He eventually suffers a nervous breakdown and runs amok, getting stuck within a machine and throwing the factory into chaos; he is then sent to the hospital."

      "text": "The Working Class Party (WCP) is a left-wing political party in the United States, based in Detroit, Michigan. WCP first gained ballot access in 2016. WCP supports progressive, pro-labor and socialist policies and candidates. The party was created by Trotskyist newspaper The Spark and its supporters, which continues to endorse the party. History From 2011 to 2013, The Spark conducted a campaign to encourage the working class to organize independent of the Democratic Party. In 2014, five people active in that campaign ran for office as Independent candidates. Four candidates lost. David Roehrig won his campaign for Wayne County Community College Trustee, due to his only opponent (the Democratic incumbent) being disqualified before the election. In 2016, several dozen WCP volunteers turned in more than 50,000 signatures, above the required 31,566, which enabled WCP candidates to appear as party candidates on Michigan ballots."

      "text": "Science is a systematic discipline that builds and organises knowledge in the form of testable hypotheses and predictions about the universe. Modern science is typically divided into two – or three – major branches: the natural sciences, which study the physical world, and the social sciences, which study individuals and societies. While referred to as the formal sciences, the study of logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science are typically regarded as separate because they rely on deductive reasoning instead of the scientific method as their main methodology. Meanwhile, applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine. The history of science spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to the Bronze Age in Egypt and Mesopotamia (c. 3000–1200 BCE)."
