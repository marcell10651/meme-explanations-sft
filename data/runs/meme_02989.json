The film also co-stars Carole Bouquet, Chaim Topol, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Julian Glover, and marked the feature directorial debut of John Glen, who had served as a film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. The film was written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. Although the script is principally based on two Ian Fleming short stories, \"For Your Eyes Only\" and \"Risico\", some elements of the plot were also inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The film follows Bond as he attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek smugglers along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents."
