The first season was released on Netflix in 2024 and featured one hundred elite chefs divided into two classes: white spoons (veterans) and black spoons (newcomers), competing for the prize of ₩300 million. The first three episodes of season two aired on December 16, 2025, with the last episode of the season scheduled to be released on January 13, 2026. In January 2026, Netflix announced the series was renewed for a team-based third season. Judges The two judges were veteran restaurateur and celebrity chef, Paik Jong-won, and the only Michelin three-star chef in Korea, Anh Sung-jae. They became full from tasting so much food during the contest but Paik still ate his packed lunch too. Care was taken to ensure impartial judging."
