      "text": "A lady is a woman who behaves in a polite way. Once used to describe only women of a high social class or status, the female counterpart of lord, now it may refer to any adult woman, as gentleman can be used for men. \"Lady\" is also a formal title in the United Kingdom. \"Lady\" is used before the family name or peerage of a woman with a title of nobility or honorary title suo jure (in her own right), such as female members of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle, or the wife of a lord, a baronet, Scottish feudal baron, laird, or a knight, and also before the first name of the daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl. Etymology The word comes from Old English hlǣfdige; the first part of the word is a mutated form of hlāf, \"loaf, bread\", also seen in the corresponding hlāford, \"lord\"."

      "text": "Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcast, and display of moving-image media. Video was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode-ray tube (CRT) systems, which, in turn, were replaced by flat-panel displays. Video systems vary in display resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, color reproduction, and other qualities. Both analog and digital video can be carried on a variety of media, including radio, magnetic tape, optical discs, computer files, and network streaming. Etymology The word video comes from the Latin video, \"I see,\" the first-person singular present indicative of videre, \"to see\". History Analog video Video developed from facsimile systems developed in the mid-19th century. Mechanical video scanners, such as the Nipkow disk, were patented as early as 1884, but it took several decades before practical video systems could be developed."
