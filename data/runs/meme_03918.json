      "text": "Miss (pronounced ) is an English-language honorific typically used for a girl, for an unmarried woman (when not using another title such as \"Doctor\" or \"Dame\"), or for a married woman retaining her maiden name. Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of mistress. The plural of Miss is Misses or occasionally Mses. History Origins Like Ms and Mrs, Miss has its roots in the title Mistress. Miss was originally a title given primarily to children rather than adults. During the 1700s, its usage broadened to encompass adult women. The title emerged as a polite way to address women, reflecting changing societal norms and class distinctions. Prior to this, referring to an adult woman as a Miss might have carried connotations of prostitution. Evolution of meanings and usage The meanings of both Miss and Mrs underwent transformations over time. Historically, these titles did not solely indicate marital status."
