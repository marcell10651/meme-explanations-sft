      "text": "Two-Face is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bob Kane, and first appeared in Detective Comics #66 (August 1942). He has become one of the superhero Batman's most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. In his comic book appearances, Two-Face is the alter ego of Harvey Dent, Gotham City's former district attorney who becomes a criminal mastermind obsessed with duality and the number two. Half of his face is hideously scarred after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him. The resulting disfigurement drives him insane and causes him to make decisions based on the flip of a coin. The Modern Age of Comic Books portrays the character as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alternate personality that developed as a result of childhood abuse."

      "text": "The Welsh Corgi ( or Corgi (pl. Corgis); occasionally the etymologically consistent Corgwn ) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is thought to be derived from the Welsh words cor and ci (which is mutated to gi), meaning \"dwarf\" and \"dog\", respectively. Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Physical differences are seen between the two breeds. According to the breed standards, overall, the Cardigan is larger in weight and height and has a much longer tail than the Pembroke. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 14th century. In contrast, the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. The Pembroke is the more popular of the two, yet still appears on the Kennel Club's vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom list."

      "text": "One half is the multiplicative inverse of 2. It is an irreducible fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2. It often appears in mathematical equations, recipes and measurements. As a word One half is one of the few fractions which are commonly expressed in natural languages by suppletion rather than regular derivation. In English, for example, compare the compound \"one half\" with other regular formations like \"one-sixth\". A half can also be said to be one part of something divided into two equal parts. It is acceptable to write one half as a hyphenated word, one-half. Mathematics One half is the rational number that lies midway between 0 and 1 on the number line. Multiplication by one half is equivalent to division by two, or \"halving\"; conversely, division by one half is equivalent to multiplication by two, or \"doubling\". A number raised to the power of one half is equal to its square root. This follows from the fact that when multiplying powers, the exponents add."

This statement was contained in a joint editorial, entitled \"Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link\", printed on 7 February 1977 in People's Daily, the journal Red Flag and the PLA Daily. History The policy was advocated by the Chinese Communist Party chairman Hua Guofeng, Mao's successor, who had earlier ended the Cultural Revolution and arrested the Gang of Four. On a 7 February 1977 editorial titled \"Study the Documents Well and Grasp the Key Link\" which appeared in People's Daily, Red Flag, and People's Liberation Army Daily, Hua articulated the \"Two Whatevers\" slogan: \"We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave\"."

It was a lemon flavoured alcoholic beverage that is widely considered to have been the \"world’s first brewed alcoholic lemonade\" (despite the pre-existence of traditional drinks like sima), paving the way for similar products such as Hooper's Hooch and Mike's Hard Lemonade. Two Dogs was created in 1993 by the South Australian brewer Duncan MacGillivray. The tale behind the drink says that MacGillivray, an owner of a small brewery and pub in South Australia, was having a beer with some friends who owned a lemon farm. They mentioned that they didn't know what to do with all their lemons that they couldn't sell due to size. Duncan said \"I'll try brewing them.\" He soon had a truck of lemons on his hands and went to work brewing them. The result was a drink that started selling pretty well."
