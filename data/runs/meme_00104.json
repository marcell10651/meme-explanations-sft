      "text": "Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's own life, or the world at large. As a verb, Merriam-Webster defines hope as \"to expect with confidence\" or \"to cherish a desire with anticipation\". Among its opposites are dejection, hopelessness, and despair. Hope finds expression through many dimensions of human life, including practical reasoning, the religious virtue of hope, legal doctrine, and literature, alongside cultural and mythological aspects. In psychology American professor of psychology Barbara Fredrickson argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms, opening us to new creative possibilities. Frederickson argues that with great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas, as well as such positive emotions as happiness and joy, courage, and empowerment, drawn from four different areas of one's self: from a cognitive, psychological, social, or physical perspective."

      "text": "Simba is a fictional character in Disney’s The Lion King franchise. He first appears as a cub in The Lion King (1994), where he flees the Pride Lands after his father, Mufasa, is murdered by his uncle, Scar, who deceives Simba into believing he is responsible for the death. Years later, Simba returns as an adult to confront Scar and reclaim his rightful place as king of the Pride Lands. He subsequently appears in the sequels The Lion King II: Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1½. Created by The Lion King's screenwriters, Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton, Simba underwent several changes as the film's story developed, including making him a more sympathetic character and establishing his familial relation to Scar. Although conceived as an original character, Simba was inspired by Moses and Joseph from the Bible, as well as the title character from William Shakespeare's Hamlet."
