      "text": "Nevada ( nə-VAD-ə; Spanish: [neˈβaða] ) is a landlocked state in the Western United States. It is also sometimes placed in the Mountain West and Southwestern United States. It borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast, and Utah to the east. Nevada is the seventh-most extensive and the 32nd-most populous U.S. state. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's population live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Las Vegas is the largest city in the state. Nevada is officially known as the \"Silver State\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \"Battle Born State\" because it achieved statehood during the Civil War; as the \"Sagebrush State\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \"Sage-hen State\". Native Americans of the Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe tribes inhabit what is now Nevada."

      "text": "A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human beings as the main characters and do not necessarily have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths generally do not. The Brothers Grimm defined legend as \"folktale historically grounded\"."
