      "text": "Comes (plural comites), translated as count, was a Roman title, generally linked to a comitatus or comital office. The word comes originally meant \"companion\" or \"follower\", deriving from \"com-\" (\"with\") and \"ire\" (\"go\"). The special lasting meaning derives from the position of a follower within a comitatus, which was a retinue, or group of followers, such as those of magnates. In some instances these were sufficiently large and/or formal to justify specific denomination, such as a \"cohors amicorum\". The word comes is the origin of the much later terms for counts within the medieval nobility, and counties as their territorial jurisdictions. Ancient Roman religion Comes was a common epithet or title that was added to the name of a hero or god in order to denote relation with another god. The coinage of Roman Emperor Constantine I declared him \"comes\" to Sol Invictus (\"Unconquered Sun\") qua god."

      "text": "The Small Faces were an English rock band from London, founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of singer/guitarist Steve Marriott, bassist Ronnie Lane, drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston in 1966. The band were initially one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the mid-1960s, with hit singles such as \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" (1965), \"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\" and \"All or Nothing\" (both 1966). From 1967, they evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands, achieving further hit singles including \"Here Come the Nice\", \"Itchycoo Park\", \"Tin Soldier\" (all 1967) and \"Lazy Sunday\" (1968), the latter taken from their critically-acclaimed concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (1968), which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1969, Marriott left to form Humble Pie, while Lane, Jones and McLagan continued under the shortened name the Faces with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood."

      "text": "A name is a term used for identification by an external observer. They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its referent. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \"common names\" or (obsolete) \"general names\". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name. Etymology The word name comes from Old English nama; cognate with Old High German (OHG) namo, Sanskrit नामन् (nāman), Latin nomen, Greek ὄνομα (onoma), and Persian نام (nâm), from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *h₁nómn̥."

The word is derived from \"toddle\", which means to walk unsteadily, as children at this age do. Developmental milestones Toddler development can be broken down into a number of interrelated areas. There is reasonable consensus about what these areas may include: Physical: growth or an increase in size. Gross motor: the control of large muscles which enable walking, running, jumping and climbing. Fine motor: the ability to control small muscles; enabling the toddler to feed themselves, draw and manipulate objects. Vision: the ability to see near and far and interpret what is seen. Hearing and speech: the ability to hear and receive information and listen (interpret), and the ability to understand and learn language and use it to communicate effectively."
