The word is derived from \"toddle\", which means to walk unsteadily, as children at this age do. Developmental milestones Toddler development can be broken down into a number of interrelated areas. There is reasonable consensus about what these areas may include: Physical: growth or an increase in size. Gross motor: the control of large muscles which enable walking, running, jumping and climbing. Fine motor: the ability to control small muscles; enabling the toddler to feed themselves, draw and manipulate objects. Vision: the ability to see near and far and interpret what is seen. Hearing and speech: the ability to hear and receive information and listen (interpret), and the ability to understand and learn language and use it to communicate effectively."
