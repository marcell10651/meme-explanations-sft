      "text": "A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die (originally titled Una Ragione Per Vivere E Una Per Morire, also known as Massacre at Fort Holman) is a 1972 Technicolor Italian spaghetti Western movie starring James Coburn, Bud Spencer, and Telly Savalas. Many exterior scenes were filmed at the Fort Bowie set built in the Province of Almería, Spain, where the desert landscape and climate that characterizes part of the province have made it a much utilized setting for Western films, among those A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West, and later 800 Bullets. The Fort Bowie set was originally built for the film The Deserter. There are two different English language versions of the movie, shorter with James Coburn's own voice and longer with different voice actors and music. James Coburn was not involved in longer cut dubbing. It also features some of the same songs from Day of Anger starring Lee Van Cleef."

      "text": "Yeah Yeah Yeahs are an American indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000. The group consists of vocalist/pianist Karen O, guitarist/keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase; they do not have a bassist but have been complemented during live shows by David Pajo and Imaad Wasif. They are known for energetic performances and a blend of genres, including art rock and dance-rock. Yeah Yeah Yeahs found critical and commercial success with their debut album, Fever to Tell (2003), which is cited as their best work. It produced the breakthrough single \"Maps\", which became the band's signature song. They issued a second album, Show Your Bones (2006), and shifted to dance-punk with their third, It's Blitz! (2009). Both records received positive reviews, and the latter spawned the hit single \"Heads Will Roll\". The band's fourth album, Mosquito (2013), became their highest-charting record in the United States but did not match the reception of its predecessors."
