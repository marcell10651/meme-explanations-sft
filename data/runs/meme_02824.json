      "text": "Two-Face is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bob Kane, and first appeared in Detective Comics #66 (August 1942). He has become one of the superhero Batman's most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. In his comic book appearances, Two-Face is the alter ego of Harvey Dent, Gotham City's former district attorney who becomes a criminal mastermind obsessed with duality and the number two. Half of his face is hideously scarred after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him. The resulting disfigurement drives him insane and causes him to make decisions based on the flip of a coin. The Modern Age of Comic Books portrays the character as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alternate personality that developed as a result of childhood abuse."

      "text": "The Small Faces were an English rock band from London, founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of singer/guitarist Steve Marriott, bassist Ronnie Lane, drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston in 1966. The band were initially one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the mid-1960s, with hit singles such as \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" (1965), \"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\" and \"All or Nothing\" (both 1966). From 1967, they evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands, achieving further hit singles including \"Here Come the Nice\", \"Itchycoo Park\", \"Tin Soldier\" (all 1967) and \"Lazy Sunday\" (1968), the latter taken from their critically-acclaimed concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (1968), which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1969, Marriott left to form Humble Pie, while Lane, Jones and McLagan continued under the shortened name the Faces with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood."

      "text": "\"Everytime\" is a song by American singer Britney Spears from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was released as the third single from In the Zone on May 10, 2004, by Jive Records. After her relationship with Justin Timberlake ended in 2002, Spears became friends with her background singer Annet Artani. They started writing songs together at Spears' house in Los Angeles, and then traveled to Lombardy, Italy, where they collaborated on \"Everytime\". Musically, it is a piano-driven pop ballad, which lyrically pleas for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. Spears composed the music herself and wrote the lyrics with Artani about a romantic breakup. \"Everytime\" received universal acclaim from music critics, who praised its lyrics, composition, and Spears' breathy vocals and songwriting, deeming it amongst the highlights of In the Zone."
