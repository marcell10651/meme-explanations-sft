      "text": "User experience (UX) is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system, or service. It includes a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. Improving user experience is important to most companies, designers, and creators when creating and refining products because negative user experience can diminish the use of the product and, therefore, any desired positive impacts. Conversely, designing toward profitability as a main objective often conflicts with ethical user experience objectives and even causes harm. User experience is subjective. However, the attributes that make up the user experience are objective. Definitions According to Nielsen Norman Group, 'user experience' includes all the aspects of the interaction between the end-user with the company, its services, and its products."

Since the 20th century, almost all cigars are made of three distinct components: the filler, the binder leaf which holds the filler together, and a wrapper leaf, which is often the highest quality leaf used. Often there will be a cigar band printed with the cigar manufacturer's logo. Modern cigars can come with two or more bands, especially Cuban cigars, showing Limited Edition (Edición Limitada) bands displaying the year of production. Cigar tobacco is grown in significant quantities primarily in Brazil, Central America (Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama), and the islands of the Caribbean (Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Puerto Rico); it is also produced in the Eastern United States (mostly in Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia) and in the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Greece, Spain (in the"
