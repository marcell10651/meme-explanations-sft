A period during which goods are sold for a reduced price may also be referred to as a \"sale\". The seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in an interaction with a buyer, which may occur at the point of sale or in response to a purchase order from a customer. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The seller, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment."

      "text": "The Welsh Corgi ( or Corgi (pl. Corgis); occasionally the etymologically consistent Corgwn ) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is thought to be derived from the Welsh words cor and ci (which is mutated to gi), meaning \"dwarf\" and \"dog\", respectively. Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Physical differences are seen between the two breeds. According to the breed standards, overall, the Cardigan is larger in weight and height and has a much longer tail than the Pembroke. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 14th century. In contrast, the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. The Pembroke is the more popular of the two, yet still appears on the Kennel Club's vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom list."
