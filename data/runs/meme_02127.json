The exact time frame of the shortening is unknown, though it has been noted that this form appears not to have been known to William Shakespeare, for whom \"please you\" is the shortest form used in any of his works. A variation of the phrase, \"may it please the court\", remains in use as a formality for attorneys addressing judges in legal proceedings. Despite its straightforward definition..."

      "text": "An auction is usually a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bids, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder or buying the item from the lowest bidder. Some exceptions to this definition exist and are described in the section about different types. The branch of economic theory dealing with auction types and participants' behavior in auctions is called auction theory. The open ascending price auction is arguably the most common form of auction and has been used throughout history. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid being higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, while bidders submit bids vocally or electronically. Auctions are applied for trade in diverse contexts."
