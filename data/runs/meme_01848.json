      "text": "Two-Face is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bob Kane, and first appeared in Detective Comics #66 (August 1942). He has become one of the superhero Batman's most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. In his comic book appearances, Two-Face is the alter ego of Harvey Dent, Gotham City's former district attorney who becomes a criminal mastermind obsessed with duality and the number two. Half of his face is hideously scarred after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him. The resulting disfigurement drives him insane and causes him to make decisions based on the flip of a coin. The Modern Age of Comic Books portrays the character as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alternate personality that developed as a result of childhood abuse."

In this episode, a man finds his hometown is suddenly inconsistent with his memories of it and begins experiencing irrational urges to commit murder, two mysteries which together lead him to an unpleasant discovery about his identity. Opening narration What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare. It isn't – it's the beginning. Although Alan Talbot doesn't know it, he's about to enter a strange new world, too incredible to be real, too real to be a dream. It's called The Twilight Zone. Plot While waiting in a subway station, Alan Talbot is approached by an evangelist."
