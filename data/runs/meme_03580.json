It was founded by Raymond Minnite of Hiawatha, Utah in 1954. While sitting at the corner of Clarkson Ave and Derrick Ave (HWY 33) counting cars, and dreaming about how many he could make stop, he noticed three large boulders off in the horizon where the Sierra Madre mountain range met the sky, known historically as the Joaquin Rocks, or Las Tres Piedras. This would become the name of the town he founded. Demographics Three Rocks first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. census. The 2020 United States census reported that Three Rocks had a population of 248. The population density was 330.7 inhabitants per square mile (127.7/km2)."

      "text": "The Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from trinus 'threefold') is a Christian doctrine concerning the nature of God, which defines one God existing in three coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons (hypostases) sharing one essence/substance/nature (homoousion). As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, it is the Father who begets, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds. In this context, one essence/nature defines what God is, while the three persons define who God is. This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes \"from the Father\", \"through the Son\", and \"in the Holy Spirit\"."
