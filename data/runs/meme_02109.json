      "text": "A meme ( ; MEEM) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online. Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution."

Bad Luck Brian is an image macro style of meme. His captions describe a variety of unlucky, embarrassing and tragic events. Meme Origin On January 23, 2012, at 2:15 UTC, Ian Davies uploaded a photo to Reddit of his friend Kyle Craven. Craven and Davies both attended Archbishop Hoban High School in Akron, Ohio. The photo which became Bad Luck Brian was originally taken for the high school's 2005–06 yearbook. Craven stated that he rubbed his face with a sweater to redden it and donned a goofy smile. The school principal required him to retake the photo, but Craven and Davies had already scanned and saved the original picture."
