      "text": "Morning is either the period from sunrise to noon, or the period from midnight to noon. In the first definition it is preceded by the twilight period of dawn, and there are no exact times for when morning begins (also true of evening and night) because it can vary according to one's latitude, and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, when afternoon starts. Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Originally, the term referred to sunrise. Etymology The Modern English words \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\" began in Middle English as morwening, developing into morwen, then morwe, and eventually morrow. English, unlike some other languages, has separate terms for \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\", despite their common root. Other languages, like Dutch, Scots and German, may use a single word – morgen – to signify both \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\"."

Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996. Most millennials are the children of baby boomers and older Gen Xers, and are often the parents of Generation Alpha. As children in the late 1980s to 2000s, millennials saw the rise of the Information Age and Internet, being described by some as the first global generation. As adolescents and young adults in the late 1990s to 2010s, the generation was marked by a more upbeat youth culture, elevated familiarity with the Internet and technology in general, and usage of early social media platforms such as AOL Instant Messenger, LiveJournal, and Myspace."

      "text": "A post-credits scene (also known as a stinger, end tag, or credit cookie) is a short teaser clip that appears after the closing credits have rolled and sometimes after a production logo of a film, TV show, or video game has run. It is usually either written for humor or to set up a sequel. Sometimes, one or more mid-credits scenes are also inserted partly through the closing credits, typically for the purpose of maintaining the audience's attention so they do not need to wait for the entire credits roll to finish for a teaser. History Post-credits scenes may have their origins in encores, an additional performance added to the end of staged shows in response to audience applause. Opera encores were common practice in the 19th century, when the story was often interrupted so a singer could repeat an aria, but fell out of favor in the 1920s due to rising emphasis on dramatic storytelling rather than vocal performance."
