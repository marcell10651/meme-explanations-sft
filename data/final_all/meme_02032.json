Once used to describe only women of a high social class or status, the female counterpart of lord, now it may refer to any adult woman, as gentleman can be used for men. \"Lady\" is also a formal title in the United Kingdom. \"Lady\" is used before the family name or peerage of a woman with a title of nobility or honorary title suo jure (in her own right), such as female members of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle, or the wife of a lord, a baronet, Scottish feudal baron, laird, or a knight, and also before the first name of the daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl. Etymology The word comes from Old English hlǣfdige; the first part of the word is a mutated form of hlāf, \"loaf, bread\", also seen in the corresponding hlāford, \"lord\"."

      "text": "Miss (pronounced ) is an English-language honorific typically used for a girl, for an unmarried woman (when not using another title such as \"Doctor\" or \"Dame\"), or for a married woman retaining her maiden name. Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of mistress. The plural of Miss is Misses or occasionally Mses. History Origins Like Ms and Mrs, Miss has its roots in the title Mistress. Miss was originally a title given primarily to children rather than adults. During the 1700s, its usage broadened to encompass adult women. The title emerged as a polite way to address women, reflecting changing societal norms and class distinctions. Prior to this, referring to an adult woman as a Miss might have carried connotations of prostitution. Evolution of meanings and usage The meanings of both Miss and Mrs underwent transformations over time. Historically, these titles did not solely indicate marital status."

It is often used as a disparaging and obscene term for a woman in the United States, an unpleasant or objectionable person (regardless of gender) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, or a contemptible man in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, it can also be a neutral or positive term when used with a positive qualifier (e.g., \"He's a good cunt\"). The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. History The earliest known use of the word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was as part of a placename: an Oxford street called Gropecunt Lane, c. 1230, now by the name of Grove Passage or Magpie Lane. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century."
