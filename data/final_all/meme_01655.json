It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal. Amusement is considered an \"epistemological\" emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke. Emotions perceived overtime are focused on the daily dynamics of life as augment or blunt. The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling. Current studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and sociology."

In all versions of the story, they are depicted as little people who form the workforce of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, and are paid in cocoa beans. However, their appearance and backstory change depending on the version. Design and characteristics The Oompa-Loompas are described as being no larger than medium-sized dolls, with rosy-white skin and long golden-brown hair. They wear the same clothes they wore at Loompaland: the men wear deerskins, the women wear leaves and the children wear nothing at all. Before moving to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the Oompa-Loompas lived in Loompaland, where they lived in constant fear of the predators that would eat them. Their main source of food were green caterpillars that tasted disgusting, so they would mash the caterpillars with bugs and plants to make them slightly less disgusting."
