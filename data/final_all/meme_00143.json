The word is derived from \"toddle\", which means to walk unsteadily, as children at this age do. Developmental milestones Toddler development can be broken down into a number of interrelated areas. There is reasonable consensus about what these areas may include: Physical: growth or an increase in size. Gross motor: the control of large muscles which enable walking, running, jumping and climbing. Fine motor: the ability to control small muscles; enabling the toddler to feed themselves, draw and manipulate objects. Vision: the ability to see near and far and interpret what is seen. Hearing and speech: the ability to hear and receive information and listen (interpret), and the ability to understand and learn language and use it to communicate effectively."

It is the totality of things relevant to some subject matter. The universe is everything that exists theoretically, though a multiverse may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an anthropocentric worldview, or the sum of human experience, history, and the human condition in general.

To describe or know of everything as a spatial consideration in a local environment, such as the world in which humans mostly live, is possible.

On 28 April 1997, the song was released as the first single from Flaming Pie, peaking at No. 3 in Spain and No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart. The single featured two non-album B-sides: \"Looking for You\" and \"Broomstick\". In the United States, Capitol Records chose to issue \"The World Tonight\" as the album's lead single instead."
