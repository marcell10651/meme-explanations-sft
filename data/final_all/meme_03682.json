It borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast, and Utah to the east. Nevada is the seventh-most extensive and the 32nd-most populous U.S. state. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's population live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Las Vegas is the largest city in the state. Nevada is officially known as the \"Silver State\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \"Battle Born State\" because it achieved statehood during the Civil War; as the \"Sagebrush State\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \"Sage-hen State\". Native Americans of the Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe tribes inhabit what is now Nevada."

It also borders Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, and Nevada to the west. In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is the 13th-largest by area, the 30th-most populous, and the 11th-least densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and Washington County in the southwest, which has approximately 180,000 residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin. Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various Indigenous peoples, such as the ancient Puebloans, the Navajo, and the Ute."
