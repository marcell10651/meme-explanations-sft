      "text": "\"Gangnam Style\" (Korean: 강남스타일; pronounced [kaŋ.nam sɯ.tʰa.il]) is a K-pop song by South Korean singer Psy, released on July 15, 2012, by YG Entertainment as the lead single of his sixth studio album, Psy 6 (Six Rules), Part 1. The term \"Gangnam Style\" is a neologism that refers to the nouveau riche lifestyles associated with the Gangnam region of Seoul. \"Gangnam Style\" was released on to Psy's YouTube channel and debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Chart, receiving generally positive reviews, with praise for its catchy beat and Psy's amusing dancing during live performances and in various locations around the world in its music video. The song and its music video went viral in August 2012 and have influenced popular culture worldwide. In the United States, \"Gangnam Style\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, which at the time, was the highest charting song by a South Korean artist."
