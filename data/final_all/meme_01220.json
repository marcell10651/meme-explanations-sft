      "text": "A mouth also referred to as the oral is the body orifice through which many animals ingest food and vocalize. The body cavity immediately behind the mouth opening, known as the oral cavity (or cavum oris in Latin), is also the first part of the alimentary canal, which leads to the pharynx and the gullet. In tetrapod vertebrates, the mouth is bounded on the outside by the lips and cheeks — thus the oral cavity is also known as the buccal cavity (from Latin bucca, meaning \"cheek\") — and contains the tongue on the inside. Except for some groups like birds and lissamphibians, vertebrates usually have teeth in their mouths, although some fish species have pharyngeal teeth instead of oral teeth. Most bilaterian phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and chordates, have a two-opening gut tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes and deuterostomes."

      "text": "A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment, and often employed for rituals and rites. Masks have been used since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes, as well as in the performing arts and for entertainment. They are usually worn on the face, although they may also be positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer's body. In art history, especially sculpture, \"mask\" is the term for a face without a body that is not modelled in the round (which would make it a \"head\"), but for example appears in low relief. Etymology The word \"mask\" appeared in English in the 1530s, from Middle French masque \"covering to hide or guard the face\", derived in turn from Italian maschera, from Medieval Latin masca \"mask, specter, nightmare\". This word is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Arabic maskharah مَسْخَرَۃٌ \"buffoon\", from the verb sakhira \"to ridicule\"."
