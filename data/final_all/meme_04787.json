The group consists of vocalist/pianist Karen O, guitarist/keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase; they do not have a bassist but have been complemented during live shows by David Pajo and Imaad Wasif. They are known for energetic performances and a blend of genres, including art rock and dance-rock. Yeah Yeah Yeahs found critical and commercial success with their debut album, Fever to Tell (2003), which is cited as their best work. It produced the breakthrough single \"Maps\", which became the band's signature song. They issued a second album, Show Your Bones (2006), and shifted to dance-punk with their third, It's Blitz! (2009). Both records received positive reviews, and the latter spawned the hit single \"Heads Will Roll\". The band's fourth album, Mosquito (2013), became their highest-charting record in the United States but did not match the reception of its predecessors."

      "text": "The mind is that which thinks, feels, perceives, imagines, remembers, and wills. It covers the totality of mental phenomena, including both conscious processes, through which an individual is aware of external and internal circumstances, and unconscious processes, which can influence an individual without intention or awareness. The mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life, but its exact nature is disputed. Some characterizations focus on internal aspects, saying that the mind transforms information and is not directly accessible to outside observers. Others stress its relation to outward conduct, understanding mental phenomena as dispositions to engage in observable behavior. The mind–body problem is the challenge of explaining the relation between matter and mind. Traditionally, mind and matter were often thought of as distinct substances that could exist independently from one another."

      "text": "A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissue concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head. Human head The human head is an anatomical unit that consists of the skull, hyoid bone and cervical vertebrae. The skull consists of the brain case which encloses the cranial cavity, and the facial skeleton, which includes the mandible. There are eight bones in the brain case and fourteen in the facial skeleton."
