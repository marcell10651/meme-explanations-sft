      "text": "The Oompa-Loompas are a fictional race of people in the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory franchise based on the original book by Roald Dahl. In all versions of the story, they are depicted as little people who form the workforce of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, and are paid in cocoa beans. However, their appearance and backstory change depending on the version. Design and characteristics The Oompa-Loompas are described as being no larger than medium-sized dolls, with rosy-white skin and long golden-brown hair. They wear the same clothes they wore at Loompaland: the men wear deerskins, the women wear leaves and the children wear nothing at all. Before moving to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the Oompa-Loompas lived in Loompaland, where they lived in constant fear of the predators that would eat them. Their main source of food were green caterpillars that tasted disgusting, so they would mash the caterpillars with bugs and plants to make them slightly less disgusting."

      "text": "Donald is a Scottish masculine given name. It is derived from the Gaelic name Dòmhnall. This comes from the Proto-Celtic *Dumno-ualos (\"world-ruler\" or \"world-wielder\"). The final -d in Donald is partly derived from a misinterpretation of the Gaelic pronunciation by English speakers. A short form of Donald is Don, and pet forms of Donald include Donnie and Donny. The feminine given name Donella is derived from Donald. Donald has cognates in other Celtic languages: Modern Irish Dónal (anglicised as Donal and Donall); Scottish Gaelic Dòmhnall, Domhnull and Dòmhnull; Welsh Dyfnwal and Cumbric Dumnagual. Although the feminine given name Donna is sometimes used as a feminine form of Donald, the names are not etymologically related."

Timon was played through his many appearances by Nathan Lane (in all three films and early episodes of the show), Max Casella (the original actor in Broadway musical), Kevin Schon (in certain episodes of the show), Quinton Flynn (in certain episodes of the show), Bruce Lanoil in the Wild About Safety shorts and Kingdom Hearts II, while Pumbaa is voiced by Ernie Sabella (in all of his traditionally animated speaking appearances), and was portrayed by Tom Alan Robbins in the original cast of the Broadway musical. In the CGI remake, the characters are portrayed by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, respectively. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella first came to audition for the roles of the hyenas, but when the producers saw how well they worked together, they decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa."

Meme Origin On January 23, 2012, at 2:15 UTC, Ian Davies uploaded a photo to Reddit of his friend Kyle Craven. Craven and Davies both attended Archbishop Hoban High School in Akron, Ohio. The photo which became Bad Luck Brian was originally taken for the high school's 2005–06 yearbook. Craven stated that he rubbed his face with a sweater to redden it and donned a goofy smile. The school principal required him to retake the photo, but Craven and Davies had already scanned and saved the original picture."
