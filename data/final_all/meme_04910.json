      "text": "Sharks are a group of elasmobranch cartilaginous fishes characterized by a ribless endoskeleton, dermal denticles, five to seven gill slits on each side, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the division Selachii and are the sister group to the Batomorphi (rays and skates). Some sources extend the term \"shark\" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million years ago). The earliest confirmed modern sharks (Selachii) are known from the Early Jurassic around 200 million years ago, with the oldest known member being Agaleus, though records of true sharks may extend back as far as the Permian."

      "text": "A decade (from Ancient Greek: δεκάς, dekas, lit. 'group of 10') is a period of 10 years. It may also be called a decennium (from Latin: decennium, lit. 'ten-year'). Decades may describe any ten-year period, such as those of a person's life, or refer to specific groupings of calendar years. Usage Any period of ten years is a 'decade' or 'decennium'. For example, the statement that \"during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time\" refers to the last 10 years of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's life without regard to which calendar years are encompassed. Also, 'the first decade' of a person's life begins on the day of their birth and ends at the end of their 10th year of life when they have their 10th birthday; the second decade of life starts with their 11th year of life (during which one is typically still referred to as being \"10\") and ends at the end of their 20th year of life, on their 20th birthday; similarly, the third decade of life, when one is in"

Every Time I Die released nine studio albums, with their final album Radical being released in October 2021. The band garnered acclaim for their energetic and intense live shows, as well as their constantly evolving sound – with Kerrang! noting that the band \"shaped the cutting edge of modern metalcore.\" History Early years, The Burial Plot Bidding War and Last Night in Town (1998–2000) Every Time I Die was founded in 1998 by Jordan Buckley, Andy Williams and Michael Novak."

      "text": "Millennials, also known as Generation Y or Gen Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996. Most millennials are the children of baby boomers and older Gen Xers, and are often the parents of Generation Alpha. As children in the late 1980s to 2000s, millennials saw the rise of the Information Age and Internet, being described by some as the first global generation. As adolescents and young adults in the late 1990s to 2010s, the generation was marked by a more upbeat youth culture, elevated familiarity with the Internet and technology in general, and usage of early social media platforms such as AOL Instant Messenger, LiveJournal, and Myspace."

It became popular among teenage and tween boys during the latter part of the 2010s and into the 2020s, particularly due to its spread on TikTok, and became an Internet meme around the same time. Definition The broccoli haircut is a hairstyle with tapered sides and short, uneven layered curls on top, which are often permed. It is referred to as such due to its resemblance to a floret of broccoli. It has also been referred to as the \"Zoomer perm\" for its popularity among members of Generation Z, as well as \"bird's nest hair\", \"bussin haircut\" or \"alpaca hair\". It has been described as a variation on a bowl cut."

A centennial or centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier. Start and end of centuries Although a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years, there are two viewpoints on the nature of standard centuries. One is based on strict construction, while the other is based on popular perception. According to the strict construction, the 1st century AD, which began with AD 1, ended with AD 100, and the 2nd century with AD 200; in this model, the n-th century starts with a year that follows a year with a multiple of 100 (except the first century as it began after the year 1 BC) and ends with the next coming year with a multiple of 100 (100n), i.e."
