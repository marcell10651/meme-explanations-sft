      "text": "Your Choice is the ninth Korean extended play (EP) and eleventh overall by South Korean boy band Seventeen. Released through Pledis Entertainment on June 18, 2021, the album comes eight months after its predecessor, Semicolon. Characterized by hip hop and R&B elements, the album consists of six tracks, including the lead single, \"Ready to Love\". As part of the group's \"Power of 'Love'\" project, the album depicts the nature of love, and experiments with various genres, including disco funk, rock, and retro R&B. Seventeen promoted the album through performances on several South Korean and American music shows. Although the album received mixed reviews from critics, it achieved commercial success, selling over a million copies within its first four days of release. Your Choice topped the Gaon Album Chart and Billboard's World Albums Chart and debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200. It charted nationally in 11 countries, reaching the top ten in Japan and Croatia."
