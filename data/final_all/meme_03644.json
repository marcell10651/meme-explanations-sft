The line of toys was created by David Gonzales and based on a comic strip that Gonzales created featuring a cast of characters from his youth. Introduced in the year 1998, Homies were initially sold in grocery store vending machines and have become a highly collectible item, and have spawned many imitation toys. Background and history Gonzales began drawing comics while he was in high school. His amateur comic strip was called The Adventures of Chico Loco, and the characters were based on \"barrio guys,\" as Gonzales grew up on the tough streets of a poverty-ridden Mexican-American neighborhood. The main character, based on Gonzales himself, was called \"Hollywood.\" The strip, which later changed its title to The Adventures of Hollywood, was picked up by Lowrider magazine and published monthly."

In all versions of the story, they are depicted as little people who form the workforce of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, and are paid in cocoa beans. However, their appearance and backstory change depending on the version. Design and characteristics The Oompa-Loompas are described as being no larger than medium-sized dolls, with rosy-white skin and long golden-brown hair. They wear the same clothes they wore at Loompaland: the men wear deerskins, the women wear leaves and the children wear nothing at all. Before moving to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the Oompa-Loompas lived in Loompaland, where they lived in constant fear of the predators that would eat them. Their main source of food were green caterpillars that tasted disgusting, so they would mash the caterpillars with bugs and plants to make them slightly less disgusting."

It constitutes the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders China and Russia to the north at the Yalu (Amnok) and Tumen rivers, and South Korea to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. North Korea, like South Korea, claims to be the sole legitimate government of the Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands. Pyongyang is the capital and largest city. The Korean Peninsula was first inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897)."

Founded on October 16, 1923, as an animation studio by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Oliver Disney as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, Disney operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before adopting its current name in 1986. In 1928, Disney established itself as a leader in the animation industry with the short film Steamboat Willie. The film used synchronized sound to become the first post-produced sound cartoon, and popularized Mickey Mouse, who became Disney's mascot and corporate icon. After becoming a success by the early 1940s, Disney diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s. However, following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, especially in the animation sector, began to decline."
