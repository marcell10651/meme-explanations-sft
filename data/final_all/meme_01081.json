The album features Noel Gallagher on lead guitar, backing vocals and as chief songwriter, Liam Gallagher on lead vocals, Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs on rhythm guitar, Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan on bass guitar and Tony McCarroll on drums. The band booked Monnow Valley Studio near Rockfield in January 1994 to record the album; they worked with producer Dave Batchelor, whom Noel Gallagher knew from his time working as a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets. However, sessions were unsatisfactory, and Batchelor was subsequently fired. In February 1994, the group began re-recording the album at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall, where Noel produced sessions alongside Mark Coyle."
