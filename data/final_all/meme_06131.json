      "text": "In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions. Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil. The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context. History of Western ideas Every language has a word expressing good in the sense of \"having the right or desirable quality\" (ἀρετή) and bad in the sense \"undesirable\". A sense of moral judgment and a distinction \"right and wrong, good and bad\" are cultural universals. Plato and Aristotle Although the history of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of \"good\" are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of significant historical effect."

Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members. Human social structures are complex and highly cooperative, featuring the specialization of labor via social roles. Societies construct roles and other patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts acceptable or unacceptable—these expectations around behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. So far as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis."
