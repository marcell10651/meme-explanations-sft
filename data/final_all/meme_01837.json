The most common use of the title is in the retail industry, but this job title is also used in the context of accountancy for the person responsible for receiving and disbursing money or within branch banking in the United Kingdom for the job known in the United States as a bank teller. Retail In a shop, a cashier (or checkout operator) is an employee who scans the goods that the customer wishes to purchase through a cash register. In most modern stores, the items are scanned by a barcode positioned on the item with the use of a laser scanner. After all of the items have been scanned, the cashier then collects the payment (in cash, check, and/or by credit/debit card) for the goods or services exchanged, records the amount received, makes change, and issues receipts or tickets to customers."

The primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value. Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for \"all debts, public and private\", in the case of the United States dollar."

      "text": "A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and beverages to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, featuring a wide variety of cuisines and service models — ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants to high-priced luxury establishments. Etymology The word derives from the early 19th century, taken from the French word restaurer 'provide meat for', literally 'restore to a former state' and, being the present participle of the verb, the term restaurant may have been used in 1507 as a \"restorative beverage\", and in correspondence in 1521 to mean 'that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy'. History A public eating-establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt."
