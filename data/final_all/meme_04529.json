      "text": "Perfection is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. The term designates a range of diverse, if often kindred, concepts used in a variety of fields. Term and concept The noun \"perfection\", the adjective \"perfect\", and the verb \"to perfect\" derive from the Latin verb \"perficere\" – \"to finish\" or \"to bring to an end\". The ancient Greek word for \"perfection\" was \"teleiotes\". The Greek polymath Aristotle (384–322 BCE) distinguished three concepts of perfection: 1. that which was complete – which contained all the requisite parts; 2. that which was so good that nothing of the kind could be better; 3. that which had attained its purpose. The Polish philosopher Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886 – 1980) notes that perfection is often confused with other qualities, such as \"excellence\". The German polymath Leibniz (1646–1716), who thought the world to be the best of all possible worlds, never called it perfect."

      "text": "Light, visible light, or visible radiation is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively optical radiation. In physics, the term \"light\" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. This is why visible radiation is commonly termed visible light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization. Its speed in vacuum, 299792458 m/s, is one of the fundamental constants of nature."

      "text": "Draco Lucius Malfoy is a fictional character and a major antagonist in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. He is a student in Harry Potter's year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is frequently accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who act as henchmen. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get what he wants; he is also a cunning user of magic. He was played by Tom Felton in the Harry Potter film series, while Lox Pratt is set to portray him in the TV series adaptation. Character development Draco serves as a foil to the hero, Harry Potter, and is loosely based on bullies Rowling encountered during her school days. Harry first encounters Draco's snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin's. Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments."
