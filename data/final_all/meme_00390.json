      "text": "Yeah Yeah Yeahs are an American indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000. The group consists of vocalist/pianist Karen O, guitarist/keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase; they do not have a bassist but have been complemented during live shows by David Pajo and Imaad Wasif. They are known for energetic performances and a blend of genres, including art rock and dance-rock. Yeah Yeah Yeahs found critical and commercial success with their debut album, Fever to Tell (2003), which is cited as their best work. It produced the breakthrough single \"Maps\", which became the band's signature song. They issued a second album, Show Your Bones (2006), and shifted to dance-punk with their third, It's Blitz! (2009). Both records received positive reviews, and the latter spawned the hit single \"Heads Will Roll\". The band's fourth album, Mosquito (2013), became their highest-charting record in the United States but did not match the reception of its predecessors."
