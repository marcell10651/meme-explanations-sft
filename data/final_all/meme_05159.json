It was released theatrically on April 27, 2022. Plot Lawyer Kang Ho-chang receives a call to from his son's teacher Song Jeong-wook to come to Haneum International School, where he meets four other parents: math teacher Jung, retired police officer Park Mu-Taek and his wife, and doctor Do Ji-yeol. The school's principal informs them that one of the students, Kim Gon-woo, was rescued from drowning in a lake.

      "text": "Snakes are elongated limbless reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Cladistically squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales much like other members of the group. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors and relatives, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most only have one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have independently evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards."
