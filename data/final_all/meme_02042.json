      "text": "\"Walkin\" is a song by American rapper Denzel Curry, released on January 24, 2022 as the lead single from his fifth studio album Melt My Eyez See Your Future (2022). It was produced by Kal Banx. Composition The production in the song changes from the style of boom bap to that of southern rap, juxtaposed with vocals. Lyrically, Denzel Curry raps about the struggles and changing of everyday life as the state of the world is regressing, such as racial and wealth inequality, and striving for success through difficult times, switching his flows as well. Music video A music video for the song was directed by Adrian Villagomez and released alongside the single. Taking on a sci-fi western theme, it finds Denzel Curry trekking across a desert planet alone, first walking through a village and moving past barren sand dunes, children playing on a swing set, and villains trying to kill him. He collapses on his knees several times throughout the journey."

Some of the songs on the album were reworked version of demos from Bloodhound Gang's earlier demo tapes. The album has sold 250,000 copies to date. Reception In a review for Amazon, music journalist Roni Sarig said \"BG back up their obnoxious idiocy with some fairly wise musical maneuvering. While their age and background lead them to repeatedly mine the '80s for material--Duran Duran and Cure samples, Michael Jackson and Blondie interpolations, a \"Kids in America\" cover—their sly comments and ingenious a cappella snippets prove they're surprisingly sharp and able lads.\" On August 7, 2015, OC Weekly published a 20-year anniversary write-up of the album, stating \"what makes Use Your Fingers worthy of re-examining two decades later is how much this album not only shouldn't exist from a legal perspective, but how it managed to predict so much of the 20 years of"
