Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages encompass coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine, have been consumed for centuries. In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the psychoactive substance ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks typically refer to beverages that are traditionally alcoholic—such as beer, wine, or cocktails—but are produced with a very low alcohol by volume content. This category includes beverages that have undergone processes to remove or significantly reduce alcohol, such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines."

      "text": "Two Dogs was a ready-to-drink beverage that was first introduced in Australia in 1993 and went on to become available throughout the world. It was a lemon flavoured alcoholic beverage that is widely considered to have been the \"world’s first brewed alcoholic lemonade\" (despite the pre-existence of traditional drinks like sima), paving the way for similar products such as Hooper's Hooch and Mike's Hard Lemonade. Two Dogs was created in 1993 by the South Australian brewer Duncan MacGillivray. The tale behind the drink says that MacGillivray, an owner of a small brewery and pub in South Australia, was having a beer with some friends who owned a lemon farm. They mentioned that they didn't know what to do with all their lemons that they couldn't sell due to size. Duncan said \"I'll try brewing them.\" He soon had a truck of lemons on his hands and went to work brewing them. The result was a drink that started selling pretty well."

      "text": "Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth, proboscis, or elsewhere. Humans drink by swallowing, completed by peristalsis in the esophagus. The physiological processes of drinking vary widely among other animals. Most animals drink water to maintain bodily hydration, although many can survive on the water gained from their food. Water is required for many physiological processes. Both inadequate and (less commonly) excessive water intake are associated with health problems. Methods of drinking In humans When a liquid enters a human mouth, the swallowing process is completed by peristalsis which delivers the liquid through the esophagus to the stomach; much of the activity is assisted by gravity. The liquid may be poured from the hands or drinkware may be used as vessels. Drinking can also be by sipping or sucking, typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon."

Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours. Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, weakness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, muscle ache, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, hyper-excitability, high blood pressure, irritability, and anxiety. While the causes of a hangover are still poorly understood, several factors are known to be involved including acetaldehyde accumulation, changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disturbed prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilation, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition."
