      "text": "Centipedes (from Neo-Latin centi-, \"hundred\", and Latin pes, pedis, \"foot\") are predatory arthropods belonging to the class Chilopoda (Ancient Greek χεῖλος, kheilos, \"lip\", and Neo-Latin suffix -poda, \"foot\", describing the forcipules) of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group which includes millipedes and other multi-legged animals. Centipedes are elongated segmented (metameric) animals with one pair of legs per body segment. All centipedes are venomous and can inflict painful stings, injecting their venom through pincer-like appendages known as forcipules or toxicognaths, which are actually modified legs instead of fangs. Despite the name, no species of centipede has exactly 100 legs; the number of pairs of legs is an odd number that ranges from 15 pairs to 191 pairs. Centipedes are predominantly generalist carnivores, hunting for a variety of prey items that can be overpowered."

The term \"Gangnam Style\" is a neologism that refers to the nouveau riche lifestyles associated with the Gangnam region of Seoul. \"Gangnam Style\" was released on to Psy's YouTube channel and debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Chart, receiving generally positive reviews, with praise for its catchy beat and Psy's amusing dancing during live performances and in various locations around the world in its music video. The song and its music video went viral in August 2012 and have influenced popular culture worldwide. In the United States, \"Gangnam Style\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, which at the time, was the highest charting song by a South Korean artist."

      "text": "A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human beings as the main characters and do not necessarily have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths generally do not. The Brothers Grimm defined legend as \"folktale historically grounded\"."
