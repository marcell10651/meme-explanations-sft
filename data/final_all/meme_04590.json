He was introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997) as a half-giant who is the gamekeeper and groundskeeper at the wizarding school Hogwarts. He is a member of the Order of the Phoenix and eventually becomes the Care of Magical Creatures professor. Hagrid is portrayed by Robbie Coltrane in all eight Harry Potter films. Creation and development Rubeus Hagrid was one of the first characters Rowling created. In a 1999 interview, she explained that the name \"Hagrid\" is an Old English word, referring to hagridden, meaning 'tormented by hags'. She said it means \"you'd had a bad night\" and she explained that Hagrid \"has a lot of bad nights\" due to his heavy drinking. In Latin, \"Rubeus\" means \"red\", and was chosen because Rowling conceived of Hagrid as an \"earthy, warm, and physical man\"."

Background and history Gonzales began drawing comics while he was in high school. His amateur comic strip was called The Adventures of Chico Loco, and the characters were based on \"barrio guys,\" as Gonzales grew up on the tough streets of a poverty-ridden Mexican-American neighborhood.
