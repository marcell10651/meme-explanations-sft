      "text": "Velocity is a measurement of speed in a certain direction of motion. It is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of physical objects. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning that both magnitude and direction are needed to define it (velocity vector). The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, a quantity that is measured in metres per second (m/s or m⋅s−1) in the SI (metric) system. For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar, whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object is said to be undergoing an acceleration. Definition Average velocity The average velocity of an object over a period of time is its change in position, Δ s {\\displaystyle \\Delta s} , divided by the duration of the period, Δ t {\\displaystyle \\Delta t} , given mathematically as v ¯ = Δ..."

College students in a band named Pulse, including a porter Sudhakaran (Vinayakan), auto driver Sathyan (Sreejith Ravi) and a one leg cripple (J Kutty), inspired by the four, form a more aggressive team to fight corruption by resorting to killing corrupt individuals, their group being named \"By the people\"."

      "text": "Time travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future. Time travel is a concept in philosophy, space, time and fiction, particularly science fiction. In fiction, time travel is typically achieved through the use of a device known as a time machine. The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells's 1895 novel The Time Machine. It is uncertain whether time travel to the past would be physically possible. Such travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time, is an extensively observed phenomenon and is well understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole."
