Meme Origin On January 23, 2012, at 2:15 UTC, Ian Davies uploaded a photo to Reddit of his friend Kyle Craven. Craven and Davies both attended Archbishop Hoban High School in Akron, Ohio.

The school principal required him to retake the photo, but Craven and Davies had already scanned and saved the original picture."

      "text": "Shit happens is a slang sentence that is used as a simple existential observation that life is full of unfortunate unpredictable events, similar to \"c'est la vie\". The sentence is an acknowledgment that bad things happen to people seemingly for no particular reason. It can also be said less vulgarly, including phrases such as \"it happens\" or \"stuff happens\". History The fact that people have been remarking that \"shit happens\" has been attested from 1964, when Carl Werthman quoted an example in his UC Berkeley masters thesis; the relevant excerpt was published in The American City (edited by Anselm L. Strauss) in 1968. Examples of usage In 2011, Australian politician Tony Abbott, who was at the time Opposition Leader and leader of the Liberal Party (later becoming Prime Minister), used the sentence in an interview.

      "text": "In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions. Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil. The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context. History of Western ideas Every language has a word expressing good in the sense of \"having the right or desirable quality\" (ἀρετή) and bad in the sense \"undesirable\". A sense of moral judgment and a distinction \"right and wrong, good and bad\" are cultural universals. Plato and Aristotle Although the history of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of \"good\" are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of significant historical effect."
