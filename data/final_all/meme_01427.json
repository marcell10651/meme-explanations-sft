It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed. A Meta-operated image-centric social media platform, it is available on iOS, Android, Windows 10, and the web. Users can take photos and edit them using built-in filters and other tools, then share them on other social media platforms like Facebook. It supports 33 languages including English, Hindi, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time."

Between 1986 and 2024 Avert supported inclusive, non-judgemental information services, sponsored medical research that others refused to fund, and supported local organisations in the UK, Asia and Africa with funds to support key HIV prevention, care and treatment services. During its last ten years, Avert focused primarily on digital communications to build health literacy on HIV and sexual health, thereby supporting global efforts to end AIDS and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal for Health. In this period, Avert worked in partnership with organisations in countries most affected by HIV to develop and promote digital HIV and sexual health content and resources that are accurate, accessible, useful, and actionable. In November 2023, work began to transition Avert's core brands to African-led and African-based organisations who could maintain and grow Avert's legacy into the future."
