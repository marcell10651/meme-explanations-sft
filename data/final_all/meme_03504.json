      "text": "\"Rock Your Baby\" is the debut single by American singer George McCrae. Written and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of KC and the Sunshine Band, \"Rock Your Baby\" became an early landmark recording of disco. It was the only international hit for McCrae. The song spent two weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in July 1974, and three weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart that same month. The song also topped the Billboard R&B chart. The single has sold over 11 million copies, making it one of fewer than forty singles to have sold 10 million physical copies worldwide. Composition The backing track was recorded in 45 minutes as a demo, with Casey on keyboards, Finch on bass guitar and drums, and their fellow Sunshine Band member Jerome Smith on electric guitar. The song became one of the first pop hits to use a drum machine."

Part of the film is in spoken Korean, with the film using actors who were fluent in Korean. The film was first screened at the 28th Tokyo International Film Festival on October 23, 2015, before being released to the general public on January 9, 2016. Plot Kim Leon is a quiet apprentice working at a custom shoe shop in Japan.

      "text": "One half is the multiplicative inverse of 2. It is an irreducible fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2. It often appears in mathematical equations, recipes and measurements. As a word One half is one of the few fractions which are commonly expressed in natural languages by suppletion rather than regular derivation. In English, for example, compare the compound \"one half\" with other regular formations like \"one-sixth\". A half can also be said to be one part of something divided into two equal parts. It is acceptable to write one half as a hyphenated word, one-half. Mathematics One half is the rational number that lies midway between 0 and 1 on the number line. Multiplication by one half is equivalent to division by two, or \"halving\"; conversely, division by one half is equivalent to multiplication by two, or \"doubling\". A number raised to the power of one half is equal to its square root. This follows from the fact that when multiplying powers, the exponents add."

      "text": "In geometry, an angle is formed by two lines that meet at a point. Each line is called a side of the angle, and the point they share is called the vertex of the angle. The term angle is used to denote both geometric figures and their size or magnitude as associated quantity. Angular measure or measure of angle are sometimes used to distinguish between the measure of the quantity and figure itself. The measurement of angles is intrinsically linked with circles and rotation, and this is often visualized or defined using the arc of a circle centered at the vertex and lying between the sides. Fundamentals There is no universally agreed definition of an angle. Angles can be conceived of and used in a variety of ways and while valid definitions may be given for specific contexts, it is difficult to give a single formal definition that is completely satisfactory in capturing all aspects of the general concept of angle."
