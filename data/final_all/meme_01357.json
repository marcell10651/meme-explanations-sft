      "text": "\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Recorded on 17 October 1963 and released on 29 November 1963 in the United Kingdom, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track recording equipment. With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the UK, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" would have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release had it not been blocked by the group's first million-seller \"She Loves You\", their previous UK single, which was having a resurgence of popularity following intense media coverage of the group. Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top 50 for 21 weeks in total, and was the Christmas number one of 1963."

Characterized by hip hop and R&B elements, the album consists of six tracks, including the lead single, \"Ready to Love\". As part of the group's \"Power of 'Love'\" project, the album depicts the nature of love, and experiments with various genres, including disco funk, rock, and retro R&B. Seventeen promoted the album through performances on several South Korean and American music shows. Although the album received mixed reviews from critics, it achieved commercial success, selling over a million copies within its first four days of release. Your Choice topped the Gaon Album Chart and Billboard's World Albums Chart and debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200. It charted nationally in 11 countries, reaching the top ten in Japan and Croatia."

      "text": "\"Everytime\" is a song by American singer Britney Spears from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was released as the third single from In the Zone on May 10, 2004, by Jive Records. After her relationship with Justin Timberlake ended in 2002, Spears became friends with her background singer Annet Artani. They started writing songs together at Spears' house in Los Angeles, and then traveled to Lombardy, Italy, where they collaborated on \"Everytime\". Musically, it is a piano-driven pop ballad, which lyrically pleas for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. Spears composed the music herself and wrote the lyrics with Artani about a romantic breakup. \"Everytime\" received universal acclaim from music critics, who praised its lyrics, composition, and Spears' breathy vocals and songwriting, deeming it amongst the highlights of In the Zone."
