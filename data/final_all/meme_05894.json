The term \"Gangnam Style\" is a neologism that refers to the nouveau riche lifestyles associated with the Gangnam region of Seoul. \"Gangnam Style\" was released on to Psy's YouTube channel and debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Chart, receiving generally positive reviews, with praise for its catchy beat and Psy's amusing dancing during live performances and in various locations around the world in its music video. The song and its music video went viral in August 2012 and have influenced popular culture worldwide. In the United States, \"Gangnam Style\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, which at the time, was the highest charting song by a South Korean artist."

      "text": "\"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy\" is a 1973 song written and recorded by James Brown, for the film Slaughter's Big Rip-Off. The song appeared on the film's soundtrack, and was released as a single in 1973. The song, and wider album, emerged from an era which saw the rise of blaxploitation films. Such films represented the struggle of African Americans against poverty and crime under a white-dominated society. While \"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy\" was received well by contemporary and modern audiences alike, it received negative reviews from critics. Brown used the same backing track and chord progression from his 1966 hit \"Money Won't Change You\" when composing the song, which prompted a poor critical response. Despite Brown's reuse of his earlier work, \"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy\" showcased the typical funk hallmarks of his more popular work. The song performed strongly on three separate Billboard charts as well as the Cashbox chart."
