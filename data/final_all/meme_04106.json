      "text": "The mind is that which thinks, feels, perceives, imagines, remembers, and wills. It covers the totality of mental phenomena, including both conscious processes, through which an individual is aware of external and internal circumstances, and unconscious processes, which can influence an individual without intention or awareness. The mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life, but its exact nature is disputed. Some characterizations focus on internal aspects, saying that the mind transforms information and is not directly accessible to outside observers. Others stress its relation to outward conduct, understanding mental phenomena as dispositions to engage in observable behavior. The mind–body problem is the challenge of explaining the relation between matter and mind. Traditionally, mind and matter were often thought of as distinct substances that could exist independently from one another."

It is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of physical objects. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning that both magnitude and direction are needed to define it (velocity vector). The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, a quantity that is measured in metres per second (m/s or m⋅s−1) in the SI (metric) system. For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar, whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object is said to be undergoing an acceleration. Definition Average velocity The average velocity of an object over a period of time is its change in position, Δ s {\\displaystyle \\Delta s} , divided by the duration of the period, Δ t {\\displaystyle \\Delta t} , given mathematically as v ¯ = Δ..."
