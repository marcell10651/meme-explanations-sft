      "text": "Perfection is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. The term designates a range of diverse, if often kindred, concepts used in a variety of fields. Term and concept The noun \"perfection\", the adjective \"perfect\", and the verb \"to perfect\" derive from the Latin verb \"perficere\" – \"to finish\" or \"to bring to an end\". The ancient Greek word for \"perfection\" was \"teleiotes\". The Greek polymath Aristotle (384–322 BCE) distinguished three concepts of perfection: 1. that which was complete – which contained all the requisite parts; 2. that which was so good that nothing of the kind could be better; 3. that which had attained its purpose. The Polish philosopher Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886 – 1980) notes that perfection is often confused with other qualities, such as \"excellence\". The German polymath Leibniz (1646–1716), who thought the world to be the best of all possible worlds, never called it perfect."

      "text": "In medicine, a surgeon is a medical doctor who performs surgery. Even though there are different traditions in different times and places, a modern surgeon is a licensed physician and received the same medical training as physicians before specializing in surgery. In some countries and jurisdictions, the title of 'surgeon' is restricted to maintain the integrity of the craft group in the medical profession. A specialist regarded as a legally recognized surgeon includes podiatry, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. It is estimated that surgeons perform over 300 million surgical procedures globally each year. History The first person to document a surgery was the 6th century BC Indian physician-surgeon, Sushruta. He specialized in cosmetic plastic surgery and even documented an open rhinoplasty procedure. His magnum opus Suśruta-saṃhitā is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of both Ayurveda and surgery."
