      "text": "Minutes (), also known as minutes of meeting, protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the activities considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the activities. The word \"minutes\" here means \"notes\", rather than sixtieths of an hour. Creation Minutes may be created during the meeting by a typist or court reporter, who may use shorthand notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards. Alternatively, the meeting can be audio recorded, video recorded, or a group's appointed or informally assigned secretary may take notes, with minutes prepared later. Many government agencies use minutes recording software to record and prepare all minutes in real-time. Purpose Minutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group."

Their Distance stars Ren, Fumiko Aoyagi, Minhyun, Hanae Kan, JR, Haruka Kinami, and Tateto Serizawa. The plot is centered around different ideas of love, from generational to cultural, told in a nonlinear narrative switching from various days in April to illustrate the perspectives of all the characters. Part of the film is in spoken Korean, with the film using actors who were fluent in Korean. The film was first screened at the 28th Tokyo International Film Festival on October 23, 2015, before being released to the general public on January 9, 2016. Plot Kim Leon is a quiet apprentice working at a custom shoe shop in Japan. Two years ago, he ran a red light on his bicycle, causing Mikio Arakawa to get hit by a car and be permanently paralyzed below his waist."

      "text": "The sone () is a unit of loudness, the subjective perception of sound pressure. The study of perceived loudness is included in the topic of psychoacoustics and employs methods of psychophysics. Doubling the perceived loudness doubles the sone value. Proposed by Stanley Smith Stevens in 1936, it is not an SI unit. Definition and conversions According to Stevens' definition, a loudness of 1 sone is equivalent to 40 phons (a 1 kHz tone at 40 dB SPL). The phons scale aligns with dB, not with loudness, so the sone and phon scales are not proportional. Rather, the loudness in sones is, at least very nearly, a power law function of the signal intensity, with an exponent of 0.3. With this exponent, each 10 phon increase (or 10 dB at 1 kHz) produces almost exactly a doubling of the loudness in sones."
