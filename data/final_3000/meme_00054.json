      "text": "Mamma Mia! (promoted as Mamma Mia! The Movie) is a 2008 jukebox musical romantic comedy film directed by Phyllida Lloyd and written by Catherine Johnson, based on her book from the 1999 musical of the same name. The film features an ensemble cast, including Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Amanda Seyfried, and Christine Baranski. The film follows a young bride-to-be named Sophie who invites three men to her upcoming wedding, with the possibility that any of them could be her real father. Principal photography primarily took place on the island of Skopelos, Greece, from August to September 2007, with ABBA members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus composing the film's score. Mamma Mia! premiered at the Leicester Square in London on June 30, 2008, before being released in the United Kingdom on July 10, and in the United States on July 18, by Universal Pictures."
