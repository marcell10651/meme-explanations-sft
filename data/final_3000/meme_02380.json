The plot follows a group of men who become embroiled in crime and betrayal after they attempt to conceal an accidental death. Very Bad Things was not well received and grossed $21 million against a $30 million budget. Plot Kyle Fisher and Laura Garrety are a young suburbanite couple days away from their wedding. While Laura finalizes last-minute wedding details, Kyle is away in Las Vegas celebrating his bachelor party with four friends—real estate agent Robert Boyd, mechanic Charles Moore, and brothers Adam and Michael Berkow. As part of the festivities, Robert hires a stripper named Tina to entertain the men in their hotel room. Tina is accidentally killed while having rough sex with Michael in the bathroom."
