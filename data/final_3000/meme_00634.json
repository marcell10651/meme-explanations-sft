      "text": "The Small Faces were an English rock band from London, founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of singer/guitarist Steve Marriott, bassist Ronnie Lane, drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston in 1966. The band were initially one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the mid-1960s, with hit singles such as \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" (1965), \"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\" and \"All or Nothing\" (both 1966). From 1967, they evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands, achieving further hit singles including \"Here Come the Nice\", \"Itchycoo Park\", \"Tin Soldier\" (all 1967) and \"Lazy Sunday\" (1968), the latter taken from their critically-acclaimed concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (1968), which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1969, Marriott left to form Humble Pie, while Lane, Jones and McLagan continued under the shortened name the Faces with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood."
