Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially, since the 1930s, in American comic books (and later in Hollywood films, film serials, television and video games), as well as in Japanese media (including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga, anime and video games). Superheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins."

      "text": "A monocle is a type of corrective lens used to correct or enhance the visual perception in only one eye. It consists of a circular lens placed in front of the eye and held in place by the eye socket itself. Often, to avoid losing the monocle, a string or wire is connected to the wearer's clothing at one end and, at the other end, to either a hole in the lens or, more often, a wire ring around its circumference. Origins The Prussian antiquarian Philipp von Stosch wore a monocle in Rome in the 1720s, in order to closely examine engravings and antique engraved gems, but the monocle did not become an article of gentlemen's apparel until the 19th century. The dandy's quizzing glass of the 1790s was an article of high fashion, which differs from the monocle in being held to one's eye with a handle in a fashion similar to a lorgnette, rather than being held in place by the eye socket itself. Styles There are three additional styles of the monocle."

This is not to be confused with underage clubbing, where individuals below the legal age (mostly younger teenagers) pretend to be older than their ages, by using a fake ID or other means, in order to be allowed into a club where they are not legally of age to be admitted into. Complaints Some complaints from people who are skeptical about the concept of underage clubs are underage clubs create an avenue for teenagers to be introduced to drugs. Another complaint is the introduction and subsequent practice of sexual activities by underage individuals within the club venues. A different complaint is the lack of adequate adult supervision within the premises of these clubs. References"

Gangsters are also called mobsters, a term derived from mob and the suffix -ster. Gangs provide a level of organization and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters have been active for many years in countries around the world. Gangsters are the subject of many novels, films, television series, and video games. Usage In modern usage, the term \"gang\" is generally used for a criminal organization and the term \"gangster\" invariably describes a criminal. Much has been written on the subject of gangs, although there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a gang or what situations lead to gang formation and evolution."

The group originally consisted of singer/guitarist Steve Marriott, bassist Ronnie Lane, drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston in 1966. The band were initially one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the mid-1960s, with hit singles such as \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" (1965), \"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\" and \"All or Nothing\" (both 1966). From 1967, they evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands, achieving further hit singles including \"Here Come the Nice\", \"Itchycoo Park\", \"Tin Soldier\" (all 1967) and \"Lazy Sunday\" (1968), the latter taken from their critically-acclaimed concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (1968), which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1969, Marriott left to form Humble Pie, while Lane, Jones and McLagan continued under the shortened name the Faces with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood."
