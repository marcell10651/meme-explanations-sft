As a largely ambiguous term, it has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, ethnic, cultural and socio-economic connotations. Its eastern boundary is marked by the Ural Mountains, and its western boundary is defined in various ways. Narrow definitions, in which Central and Southeast Europe are counted as separate regions, include Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. In contrast, broader definitions include Moldova and Romania, but also some or all of the Balkans, except East Thrace and Greece, generally speaking, the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and the Visegrád group.

Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil. The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context. History of Western ideas Every language has a word expressing good in the sense of \"having the right or desirable quality\" (ἀρετή) and bad in the sense \"undesirable\". A sense of moral judgment and a distinction \"right and wrong, good and bad\" are cultural universals. Plato and Aristotle Although the history of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of \"good\" are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of significant historical effect."
