      "text": "Two Dogs was a ready-to-drink beverage that was first introduced in Australia in 1993 and went on to become available throughout the world. It was a lemon flavoured alcoholic beverage that is widely considered to have been the \"world’s first brewed alcoholic lemonade\" (despite the pre-existence of traditional drinks like sima), paving the way for similar products such as Hooper's Hooch and Mike's Hard Lemonade. Two Dogs was created in 1993 by the South Australian brewer Duncan MacGillivray. The tale behind the drink says that MacGillivray, an owner of a small brewery and pub in South Australia, was having a beer with some friends who owned a lemon farm. They mentioned that they didn't know what to do with all their lemons that they couldn't sell due to size. Duncan said \"I'll try brewing them.\" He soon had a truck of lemons on his hands and went to work brewing them. The result was a drink that started selling pretty well."

It has a total area of 7,688,287 km2 (2,968,464 sq mi), making it the sixth-largest country in the world and the largest in Oceania. Australia is the world's flattest and driest inhabited continent. It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates including deserts in the interior and tropical rainforests along the coast. The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from Southeast Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Period. By the time of British settlement, Aboriginal Australians spoke more than 250 distinct languages and had one of the oldest living cultures in the world. Australia's written history commenced with Dutch exploration of most of the coastline in the 17th century."
