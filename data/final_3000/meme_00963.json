      "text": "White is the lightest color and is achromatic (having no chroma). It is the color of objects such as snow, chalk, and milk, and is the opposite of black. White objects fully (or almost fully) reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light. White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue, and green light. The color white can be given with white pigments, especially titanium dioxide. In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the kings of France as well as the flag of monarchist France from 1815 to 1830, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922)."

The film also co-stars Carole Bouquet, Chaim Topol, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Julian Glover, and marked the feature directorial debut of John Glen, who had served as a film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. The film was written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. Although the script is principally based on two Ian Fleming short stories, \"For Your Eyes Only\" and \"Risico\", some elements of the plot were also inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The film follows Bond as he attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek smugglers along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents."
