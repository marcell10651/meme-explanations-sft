      "text": "The Caletes or Caleti (Gaulish: Caletoi \"the hard [stubborn, tough] ones\"; Latin: Calētēs or Calētī) were a Belgic or Gallic tribe dwelling in Pays de Caux, in present-day Normandy, during the Iron Age and the Roman period. Name They are mentioned as Caletes (var. Caletos, Cadetes) by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), as Káletoi (Κάλετοι) and Kalétous (Καλέτους) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), as Galetos (var. Galletos) by Pliny (1st c. AD), as Kalē̃tai (Καλη̃ται) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), and as Caleti by Orosius (early 5th c. AD). The Gaulish ethnonym Caletoi literally means 'the hard ones', that is to say 'the stubborn' or 'the tough'. It derives from the Proto-Celtic stem *kaleto- ('hard, cruel, strong'; cf. Old Irish calath 'heroic', Middle Welsh caled 'hard'), itself from Proto-Indo-European *ḱelto-, meaning 'cold' (cf. Avest. sarǝta- 'cold', OEng. haeled 'hero', Lat. callēre 'to be hardened [by the experience], insensible')."
