The show premiered on January 18, 2003, and ended on October 18, 2013, airing on TLC in the United States. What Not to Wear was hosted by Stacy London and Clinton Kelly, though London's Season 1 co-host was Wayne Scot Lukas. Also part of the show was head makeover artist Carmindy and hairstylist Nick Arrojo from season 1 through season 6. Celebrity hairstylist Ted Gibson replaced Arrojo beginning in season 7, through season 10. On March 6, 2013, TLC announced that the tenth season of What Not to Wear would be its last. Format Participants were nominated by friends, co-workers, or relatives. Some episodes involved self-nominations, such as the class reunion specials or mall nominations. In the latter, What Not to Wear set up a 360-degree mirror in various malls across the United States, which allowed women to explain why they needed fashion help."
