      "text": "A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment, and often employed for rituals and rites. Masks have been used since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes, as well as in the performing arts and for entertainment. They are usually worn on the face, although they may also be positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer's body. In art history, especially sculpture, \"mask\" is the term for a face without a body that is not modelled in the round (which would make it a \"head\"), but for example appears in low relief. Etymology The word \"mask\" appeared in English in the 1530s, from Middle French masque \"covering to hide or guard the face\", derived in turn from Italian maschera, from Medieval Latin masca \"mask, specter, nightmare\". This word is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Arabic maskharah مَسْخَرَۃٌ \"buffoon\", from the verb sakhira \"to ridicule\"."

Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of mistress. The plural of Miss is Misses or occasionally Mses. History Origins Like Ms and Mrs, Miss has its roots in the title Mistress. Miss was originally a title given primarily to children rather than adults. During the 1700s, its usage broadened to encompass adult women. The title emerged as a polite way to address women, reflecting changing societal norms and class distinctions. Prior to this, referring to an adult woman as a Miss might have carried connotations of prostitution. Evolution of meanings and usage The meanings of both Miss and Mrs underwent transformations over time. Historically, these titles did not solely indicate marital status."
